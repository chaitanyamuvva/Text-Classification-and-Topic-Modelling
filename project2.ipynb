In a market-oriented programming approach to distributed problem solving, we derive the activities and resource allocations for a set of computational agents by computing the competitive equilibrium of an artificial economy. WALRAS provides basic constructs for defining computational market structures, and protocols for deriving their corresponding price equilibria. In a particular realization of this approach for a form of multicommodity flow problem, we see that careful construction of the decision process according to economic principles can lead to efficient distributed resource allocation, and that the behavior of the system can be meaningfully analyzed in economic terms.

GSAT performs greedy hill-climbing on the number of satisfied clauses in a truth assignment. Our experiments provide a more complete picture of GSAT's search than previous accounts. We describe in detail the two phases of search: rapid hill-climbing followed by a long plateau search. We demonstrate that when applied to randomly generated 3SAT problems, there is a very simple scaling with problem size for both the mean number of satisfied clauses and the mean branching rate. Our results allow us to make detailed numerical conjectures about the length of the hill-climbing phase, the average gradient of this phase, and to conjecture that both the average score and average branching rate decay exponentially during plateau search. We end by showing how these results can be used to direct future theoretical analysis. This work provides a case study of how computer experiments can be used to improve understanding of the theoretical properties of algorithms. \",\n",

       " ' The Difficulties of Learning Logic Programs with Cut As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning procedure for logic programs should be able to deal with it. Because the cut predicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be learned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning systems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of a space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to generate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and then make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of learning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to be a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate the difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually caused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation. As a conclusion, the analysis of this paper suggests, on precise and technical grounds, that learning cut is difficult, and current induction techniques should probably be restricted to purely declarative logic languages.

       " ' Decidable Reasoning in Terminological Knowledge Representation Systems Terminological knowledge representation systems (TKRSs) are tools for designing and using knowledge bases that make use of terminological languages (or concept languages). We analyze from a theoretical point of view a TKRS whose capabilities go beyond the ones of presently available TKRSs. The new features studied, often required in practical applications, can be summarized in three main points. First, we consider a highly expressive terminological language, called ALCNR, including general complements of concepts, number restrictions and role conjunction. Second, we allow to express inclusion statements between general concepts, and terminological cycles as a particular case. Third, we prove the decidability of a number of desirable TKRS-deduction services (like satisfiability, subsumption and instance checking) through a sound, complete and terminating calculus for reasoning in ALCNR-knowledge bases. Our calculus extends the general technique of constraint systems. As a byproduct of the proof, we get also the result that inclusion statements in ALCNR can be simulated by terminological cycles, if descriptive semantics is adopted. ',\n",

We introduce the notion of teleo-reactive (T-R) programs whose execution entails the construction of circuitry for the continuous computation of the parameters and conditions on which agent action is based. In addition to continuous feedback, T-R programs support parameter binding and recursion. A primary difference between T-R programs and many other circuit-based systems is that the circuitry of T-R programs is more compact; it is constructed at run time and thus does not have to anticipate all the contingencies that might arise over all possible runs. In addition, T-R programs are intuitive and easy to write and are written in a form that is compatible with automatic planning and learning methods. We briefly describe some experimental applications of T-R programs in the control of simulated and actual mobile robots. ',\n",

In this paper we present our approach to the theory revision problem for propositional domain theories. The approach described here, called PTR, uses probabilities associated with domain theory elements to numerically track the ``flow'' of proof through the theory. This allows us to measure the precise role of a clause or literal in allowing or preventing a (desired or undesired) derivation for a given example. This information is used to efficiently locate and repair flawed elements of the theory. PTR is proved to converge to a theory which correctly classifies all examples, and shown experimentally to be fast and accurate even for deep theories. \",\n",

Several artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been implemented, and a challenge for better symbolic models has been posed. In this paper, we present a general-purpose Symbolic Pattern Associator SPA based upon the decision-tree learning algorithm ID3. We conduct extensive head-to-head comparisons on the generalization ability between ANN models and the SPA under different representations. We conclude that the SPA generalizes the past tense of unseen verbs better than ANN models by a wide margin, and we offer insights as to why this should be the case.

We describe a new version of our SUBDUE substructure discovery system based on the minimum description length principle. The SUBDUE system discovers substructures that compress the original data and represent structural concepts in the data. By replacing previously-discovered substructures in the data, multiple passes of SUBDUE produce a hierarchical description of the structural regularities in the data. SUBDUE uses a computationally-bounded inexact graph match that identifies similar, but not identical, instances of a substructure and finds an approximate measure of closeness of two substructures when under computational constraints. In addition to the minimum description length principle, other background knowledge can be used by SUBDUE to guide the search towards more appropriate substructures. Experiments in a variety of domains demonstrate SUBDUE's ability to find substructures capable of compressing the original data and to discover structural concepts important to the domain. Description of Online Appendix: This is a compressed tar file containing the SUBDUE discovery system, written in C. The program accepts as input databases represented in graph form, and will output discovered substructures with their corresponding value. \",\n",

       " \" Similarity-Based Estimation of Word Cooccurrence Probabilities In many applications of natural language processing it is necessary to determine the likelihood of a given word combination. For example, a speech recognizer may need to determine which of the two word combinations ``eat a peach'' and ``eat a beach'' is more likely. Statistical NLP methods determine the likelihood of a word combination according to its frequency in a training corpus. However, the nature of language is such that many word combinations are infrequent and do not occur in a given corpus. In this work we propose a method for estimating the probability of such previously unseen word combinations using available information on ``most similar'' words. We describe a probabilistic word association model based on distributional word similarity, and apply it to improving probability estimates for unseen word bigrams in a variant of Katz's back-off model. The similarity-based method yields a 20% perplexity improvement in the prediction of unseen bigrams and statistically significant reductions in speech-recognition error. \",\n",

It is proposed that these features interact with one of two types of discourse inference, namely {\\\\it Common Topic} inference and {\\\\it Coherent Situation} inference.

       " ' Pearl: A Probabilistic Chart Parser This paper describes a natural language parsing algorithm for unrestricted text which uses a probability-based scoring function to select the best parse of a sentence. The parser, Pearl, is a time-asynchronous bottom-up chart parser with Earley-type top-down prediction which pursues the highest-scoring theory in the chart, where the score of a theory represents the extent to which the context of the sentence predicts that interpretation. This parser differs from previous attempts at stochastic parsers in that it uses a richer form of conditional probabilities based on context to predict likelihood. Pearl also provides a framework for incorporating the results of previous work in part-of-speech assignment, unknown word models, and other probabilistic models of linguistic features into one parsing tool, interleaving these techniques instead of using the traditional pipeline architecture. In preliminary tests, Pearl has been successful at resolving part-of-speech and word (in speech processing) ambiguity, determining categories for unknown words, and selecting correct parses first using a very loosely fitting covering grammar.

       " \" Syntactic-Head-Driven Generation The previously proposed semantic-head-driven generation methods run into problems if none of the daughter constituents in the syntacto-semantic rule schemata of a grammar fits the definition of a semantic head given in Shieber et al. 1990. This is the case for the semantic analysis rules of certain constraint-based semantic representations, e.g. Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures (UDRSs) (Frank/Reyle 1992). Since head-driven generation in general has its merits, we simply return to a syntactic definition of `head' and demonstrate the feasibility of syntactic-head-driven generation. In addition to its generality, a syntactic-head-driven algorithm provides a basis for a logically well-defined treatment of the movement of (syntactic) heads, for which only ad-hoc solutions existed, so far. \",\n",
       " ' Towards History-based Grammars: Using Richer Models for Probabilistic Parsing We describe a generative probabilistic model of natural language, which we call HBG, that takes advantage of detailed linguistic information to resolve ambiguity. HBG incorporates lexical, syntactic, semantic, and structural information from the parse tree into the disambiguation process in a novel way. We use a corpus of bracketed sentences, called a Treebank, in combination with decision tree building to tease out the relevant aspects of a parse tree that will determine the correct parse of a sentence. This stands in contrast to the usual approach of further grammar tailoring via the usual linguistic introspection in the hope of generating the correct parse. In head-to-head tests against one of the best existing robust probabilistic parsing models, which we call P-CFG, the HBG model significantly outperforms P-CFG, increasing the parsing accuracy rate from 60% to 75%, a 37% reduction in error.

       " \" Natural Language Parsing as Statistical Pattern Recognition Traditional natural language parsers are based on rewrite rule systems developed in an arduous, time-consuming manner by grammarians. A majority of the grammarian's efforts are devoted to the disambiguation process, first hypothesizing rules which dictate constituent categories and relationships among words in ambiguous sentences, and then seeking exceptions and corrections to these rules. In this work, I propose an automatic method for acquiring a statistical parser from a set of parsed sentences which takes advantage of some initial linguistic input, but avoids the pitfalls of the iterative and seemingly endless grammar development process. Based on distributionally-derived and linguistically-based features of language, this parser acquires a set of statistical decision trees which assign a probability distribution on the space of parse trees given the input sentence. These decision trees take advantage of significant amount of contextual information, potentially including all of the lexical information in the sentence, to produce highly accurate statistical models of the disambiguation process. By basing the disambiguation criteria selection on entropy reduction rather than human intuition, this parser development method is able to consider more sentences than a human grammarian can when making individual disambiguation rules. In experiments between a parser, acquired using this statistical framework, and a grammarian's rule-based parser, developed over a ten-year period, both using the same training material and test sentences, the decision tree parser significantly outperformed the grammar-based parser on the accuracy measure which the grammarian was trying to maximize, achieving an accuracy of 78% compared to the grammar-based parser's 69%. \",\n",

       " \" Best-first Model Merging for Hidden Markov Model Induction This report describes a new technique for inducing the structure of Hidden Markov Models from data which is based on the general `model merging' strategy (Omohundro 1992). The process begins with a maximum likelihood HMM that directly encodes the training data. Successively more general models are produced by merging HMM states. A Bayesian posterior probability criterion is used to determine which states to merge and when to stop generalizing. The procedure may be considered a heuristic search for the HMM structure with the highest posterior probability. We discuss a variety of possible priors for HMMs, as well as a number of approximations which improve the computational efficiency of the algorithm. We studied three applications to evaluate the procedure. The first compares the merging algorithm with the standard Baum-Welch approach in inducing simple finite-state languages from small, positive-only training samples. We found that the merging procedure is more robust and accurate, particularly with a small amount of training data. The second application uses labelled speech data from the TIMIT database to build compact, multiple-pronunciation word models that can be used in speech recognition. Finally, we describe how the algorithm was incorporated in an operational speech understanding system, where it is combined with neural network acoustic likelihood estimators to improve performance over single-pronunciation word models. \",\n",

       " \" An Integrated Heuristic Scheme for Partial Parse Evaluation GLR* is a recently developed robust version of the Generalized LR Parser, that can parse almost ANY input sentence by ignoring unrecognizable parts of the sentence. On a given input sentence, the parser returns a collection of parses that correspond to maximal, or close to maximal, parsable subsets of the original input. This paper describes recent work on developing an integrated heuristic scheme for selecting the parse that is deemed ``best'' from such a collection. We describe the heuristic measures used and their combination scheme. Preliminary results from experiments conducted on parsing speech recognized spontaneous speech are also reported. \",\n",
       " ' Grammar Specialization through Entropy Thresholds Explanation-based generalization is used to extract a specialized grammar from the original one using a training corpus of parse trees. This allows very much faster parsing and gives a lower error rate, at the price of a small loss in coverage. Previously, it has been necessary to specify the tree-cutting criteria (or operationality criteria) manually; here they are derived automatically from the training set and the desired coverage of the specialized grammar. This is done by assigning an entropy value to each node in the parse trees and cutting in the nodes with sufficiently high entropy values. ',\n",
       " \" Abductive Equivalential Translation and its application to Natural Language Database Interfacing The thesis describes a logical formalization of natural-language database interfacing. We assume the existence of a ``natural language engine'' capable of mediating between surface linguistic string and their representations as ``literal'' logical forms: the focus of interest will be the question of relating ``literal'' logical forms to representations in terms of primitives meaningful to the underlying database engine. We begin by describing the nature of the problem, and show how a variety of interface functionalities can be considered as instances of a type of formal inference task which we call ``Abductive Equivalential Translation'' AET; functionalities which can be reduced to this form include answering questions, responding to commands, reasoning about the completeness of answers, answering meta-questions of type ``Do you know...'', and generating assertions and questions. In each case, a ``linguistic domain theory'' LDT and an input formula are given, and the goal is to construct a formula with certain properties which is equivalent to , given and a set of permitted assumptions. If the LDT is of a certain specified type, whose formulas are either conditional equivalences or Horn-clauses, we show that the AET problem can be reduced to a goal-directed inference method. We present an abstract description of this method, and sketch its realization in Prolog. The relationship between AET and several problems previously discussed in the literature is discussed. In particular, we show how AET can provide a simple and elegant solution to the so-called ``Doctor on Board'' problem, and in effect allows a ``relativization'' of the Closed World Assumption. The ideas in the thesis have all been implemented concretely within the SRI CLARE project, using a real projects and payments database. The LDT for the example database is described in detail, and examples of the types of functionality that can be achieved within the example domain are presented. \",\n",

       " \" A Deductive Account of Quantification in LFG The relationship between Lexical-Functional Grammar LFG functional structures (f-structures) for sentences and their semantic interpretations can be expressed directly in a fragment of linear logic in a way that explains correctly the constrained interactions between quantifier scope ambiguity and bound anaphora. The use of a deductive framework to account for the compositional properties of quantifying expressions in natural language obviates the need for additional mechanisms, such as Cooper storage, to represent the different scopes that a quantifier might take. Instead, the semantic contribution of a quantifier is recorded as an ordinary logical formula, one whose use in a proof will establish the scope of the quantifier. The properties of linear logic ensure that each quantifier is scoped exactly once. Our analysis of quantifier scope can be seen as a recasting of Pereira's analysis (Pereira, 1991), which was expressed in higher-order intuitionistic logic. But our use of LFG and linear logic provides a much more direct and computationally more flexible interpretation mechanism for at least the same range of phenomena. We have developed a preliminary Prolog implementation of the linear deductions described in this work. \",\n",

However if there can be relations between every pair of semantic roles, the amount of computation to identify the relations that hold in the given sentence is extremely large. In this paper, for semantics of Japanese complex sentence, we introduce new pragmatic roles called `observer' and `motivated' respectively to bridge semantic roles of subordinate and those of main clauses. By these new roles constraints on the relations among semantic/pragmatic roles are known to be almost local within subordinate or main clause. In other words, as for the semantics of the whole complex sentence, the only role we should deal with is a motivated. \",\n",

It is shown that the performance of the two separate modular networks is superior to a single network responsible for both root and inflection identification. In a more elaborate version of the model, the network learns to use separate hidden-layer modules to solve the separate tasks of root and inflection identification. ',\n",

We provide a variant semantics for descriptions with respect to which the current implementation is complete, and which can be independently motivated. The soundness and completeness of the polynomial-time subsumption algorithm is established using description graphs, which are an abstracted version of the implementation structures used in CLASSIC, and are of independent interest.

In this paper, we apply a probabilistic chunker to deciding the implicit boundaries of constituents and utilize the linguistic knowledge to extract the noun phrases by a finite state mechanism.

       " ' Speech Dialogue with Facial Displays: Multimodal Human-Computer Conversation Human face-to-face conversation is an ideal model for human-computer dialogue. One of the major features of face-to-face communication is its multiplicity of communication channels that act on multiple modalities. To realize a natural multimodal dialogue, it is necessary to study how humans perceive information and determine the information to which humans are sensitive. A face is an independent communication channel that conveys emotional and conversational signals, encoded as facial expressions. We have developed an experimental system that integrates speech dialogue and facial animation, to investigate the effect of introducing communicative facial expressions as a new modality in human-computer conversation. Our experiments have shown that facial expressions are helpful, especially upon first contact with the system. We have also discovered that featuring facial expressions at an early stage improves subsequent interaction. ',\n",

We describe a method for formulating probabilistic models that use multiple contextual features for word-sense disambiguation, without requiring untested assumptions regarding the form of the model. Using this approach, the joint distribution of all variables is described by only the most systematic variable interactions, thereby limiting the number of parameters to be estimated, supporting computational efficiency, and providing an understanding of the data.

The complex agglutinative morphology of Turkish lexical structures is handled using a separate two-level morphological analyzer. After a discussion of key relevant issues regarding Turkish grammar, we discuss aspects of our system and present results from our implementation.

       " ' Some Advances in Transformation-Based Part of Speech Tagging Most recent research in trainable part of speech taggers has explored stochastic tagging. While these taggers obtain high accuracy, linguistic information is captured indirectly, typically in tens of thousands of lexical and contextual probabilities. In [Brill92], a trainable rule-based tagger was described that obtained performance comparable to that of stochastic taggers, but captured relevant linguistic information in a small number of simple non-stochastic rules. In this paper, we describe a number of extensions to this rule-based tagger. First, we describe a method for expressing lexical relations in tagging that are not captured by stochastic taggers. Next, we show a rule-based approach to tagging unknown words. Finally, we show how the tagger can be extended into a k-best tagger, where multiple tags can be assigned to words in some cases of uncertainty. ',\n",
       " \" Exploring the Statistical Derivation of Transformational Rule Sequences for Part-of-Speech Tagging Eric Brill has recently proposed a simple and powerful corpus-based language modeling approach that can be applied to various tasks including part-of-speech tagging and building phrase structure trees. The method learns a series of symbolic transformational rules, which can then be applied in sequence to a test corpus to produce predictions. The learning process only requires counting matches for a given set of rule templates, allowing the method to survey a very large space of possible contextual factors. This paper analyses Brill's approach as an interesting variation on existing decision tree methods, based on experiments involving part-of-speech tagging for both English and ancient Greek corpora. In particular, the analysis throws light on why the new mechanism seems surprisingly resistant to overtraining. A fast, incremental implementation and a mechanism for recording the dependencies that underlie the resulting rule sequence are also described. \",\n",

This paper describes an attempt to merge the Example-Based Machine Translation EBMT approach with psycholinguistic principles. A new formalism for context- free grammars, called *marker-normal form*, is demonstrated and used to describe language data in a way compatible with psycholinguistic theories. By embedding this formalism in a standard multivariate optimization framework, a system can be built that infers correct transfer functions for a set of bilingual sentence pairs and then uses those functions to translate novel sentences. The validity of this line of reasoning has been tested in the development of a system called METLA-1. This system has been used to infer English->French and English->Urdu transfer functions from small corpora. The results of those experiments are examined, both in engineering terms as well as in more linguistic terms. In general, the results of these experiments were psycho- logically and linguistically well-grounded while still achieving a respectable level of success when compared against a similar prototype using Hidden Markov Models.

       " ' Corpus-Driven Knowledge Acquisition for Discourse Analysis The availability of large on-line text corpora provides a natural and promising bridge between the worlds of natural language processing NLP and machine learning ML. In recent years, the NLP community has been aggressively investigating statistical techniques to drive part-of-speech taggers, but application-specific text corpora can be used to drive knowledge acquisition at much higher levels as well. In this paper we will show how ML techniques can be used to support knowledge acquisition for information extraction systems. It is often very difficult to specify an explicit domain model for many information extraction applications, and it is always labor intensive to implement hand-coded heuristics for each new domain. We have discovered that it is nevertheless possible to use ML algorithms in order to capture knowledge that is only implicitly present in a representative text corpus. Our work addresses issues traditionally associated with discourse analysis and intersentential inference generation, and demonstrates the utility of ML algorithms at this higher level of language analysis. The benefits of our work address the portability and scalability of information extraction IE technologies. When hand-coded heuristics are used to manage discourse analysis in an information extraction system, months of programming effort are easily needed to port a successful IE system to a new domain.

       " ' Learning Fault-tolerant Speech Parsing with SCREEN This paper describes a new approach and a system SCREEN for fault-tolerant speech parsing. SCREEEN stands for Symbolic Connectionist Robust EnterprisE for Natural language. Speech parsing describes the syntactic and semantic analysis of spontaneous spoken language. The general approach is based on incremental immediate flat analysis, learning of syntactic and semantic speech parsing, parallel integration of current hypotheses, and the consideration of various forms of speech related errors. The goal for this approach is to explore the parallel interactions between various knowledge sources for learning incremental fault-tolerant speech parsing. This approach is examined in a system SCREEN using various hybrid connectionist techniques. Hybrid connectionist techniques are examined because of their promising properties of inherent fault tolerance, learning, gradedness and parallel constraint integration. The input for SCREEN is hypotheses about recognized words of a spoken utterance potentially analyzed by a speech system, the output is hypotheses about the flat syntactic and semantic analysis of the utterance. In this paper we focus on the general approach, the overall architecture, and examples for learning flat syntactic speech parsing. Different from most other speech language architectures SCREEN emphasizes an interactive rather than an autonomous position, learning rather than encoding, flat analysis rather than in-depth analysis, and fault-tolerant processing of phonetic, syntactic and semantic knowledge.

In Dynamic Logic of Programs, the meaning of a program is a binary relation on the set of states of some abstract machine.

We establish a first-order theory FT by means of three axiom schemes, show its completeness, and construct three elementarily equivalent models. One of the models consists of so-called feature graphs, a data structure common in computational linguistics. The other two models consist of so-called feature trees, a record-like data structure generalizing the trees corresponding to first-order terms.

       " ' Analyzing and Improving Statistical Language Models for Speech Recognition In many current speech recognizers, a statistical language model is used to indicate how likely it is that a certain word will be spoken next, given the words recognized so far. How can statistical language models be improved so that more complex speech recognition tasks can be tackled? Since the knowledge of the weaknesses of any theory often makes improving the theory easier, the central idea of this thesis is to analyze the weaknesses of existing statistical language models in order to subsequently improve them. To that end, we formally define a weakness of a statistical language model in terms of the logarithm of the total probability, LTP, a term closely related to the standard perplexity measure used to evaluate statistical language models. We apply our definition of a weakness to a frequently used statistical language model, called a bi-pos model. This results, for example, in a new modeling of unknown words which improves the performance of the model by 14% to 21%. Moreover, one of the identified weaknesses has prompted the development of our generalized N-pos language model, which is also outlined in this thesis. It can incorporate linguistic knowledge even if it extends over many words and this is not feasible in a traditional N-pos model. This leads to a discussion of whatknowledge should be added to statistical language models in general and we give criteria for selecting potentially useful knowledge. These results show the usefulness of both our definition of a weakness and of performing an analysis of weaknesses of statistical language models in general. ',\n",
       " \" A Computational Model of Syntactic Processing: Ambiguity Resolution from Interpretation Syntactic ambiguity abounds in natural language, yet humans have no difficulty coping with it. In fact, the process of ambiguity resolution is almost always unconscious. But it is not infallible, however, as example 1 demonstrates. 1. The horse raced past the barn fell. This sentence is perfectly grammatical, as is evident when it appears in the following context: 2. Two horses were being shown off to a prospective buyer. One was raced past a meadow. and the other was raced past a barn. ... Grammatical yet unprocessable sentences such as 1 are called `garden-path sentences.' Their existence provides an opportunity to investigate the human sentence processing mechanism by studying how and when it fails. The aim of this thesis is to construct a computational model of language understanding which can predict processing difficulty. The data to be modeled are known examples of garden path and non-garden path sentences, and other results from psycholinguistics. It is widely believed that there are two distinct loci of computation in sentence processing: syntactic parsing and semantic interpretation. One longstanding controversy is which of these two modules bears responsibility for the immediate resolution of ambiguity. My claim is that it is the latter, and that the syntactic processing module is a very simple device which blindly and faithfully constructs all possible analyses for the sentence up to the current point of processing. The interpretive module serves as a filter, occasionally discarding certain of these analyses which it deems less appropriate for the ongoing discourse than their competitors. This document is divided into three parts. The first is introductory, and reviews a selection of proposals from the sentence processing literature. The second part explores a body of data which has been adduced in support of a theory of structural preferences --- one that is inconsistent with the present claim. I show how the current proposal can be specified to account for the available data, and moreover to predict where structural preference theories will go wrong. The third part is a theoretical investigation of how well the proposed architecture can be realized using current conceptions of linguistic competence. In it, I present a parsing algorithm and a meaning-based ambiguity resolution method. \",\n",
       " \" A Psycholinguistically Motivated Parser for CCG Considering the speed in which humans resolve syntactic ambiguity, and the overwhelming evidence that syntactic ambiguity is resolved through selection of the analysis whose interpretation is the most `sensible', one comes to the conclusion that interpretation, hence parsing take place incrementally, just about every word. Considerations of parsimony in the theory of the syntactic processor lead one to explore the simplest of parsers: one which represents only analyses as defined by the grammar and no other information. Toward this aim of a simple, incremental parser I explore the proposal that the competence grammar is a Combinatory Categorial Grammar CCG. I address the problem of the proliferating analyses that stem from CCG's associativity of derivation. My solution involves maintaining only the maximally incremental analysis and, when necessary, computing the maximally right-branching analysis.

       " \" Anytime Algorithms for Speech Parsing? This paper discusses to which extent the concept of ``anytime algorithms'' can be applied to parsing algorithms with feature unification. We first try to give a more precise definition of what an anytime algorithm is. We arque that parsing algorithms have to be classified as contract algorithms as opposed to (truly) interruptible algorithms. With the restriction that the transaction being active at the time an interrupt is issued has to be completed before the interrupt can be executed, it is possible to provide a parser with limited anytime behavior, which is in fact being realized in our research prototype. \",\n",

The algorithm exploits both local syntactic patterns and more distant collocational evidence, generating an efficient, effective, and highly perspicuous recipe for resolving a given ambiguity. By identifying and utilizing only the single best disambiguating evidence in a target context, the algorithm avoids the problematic complex modeling of statistical dependencies. Although directly applicable to a wide class of ambiguities, the algorithm is described and evaluated in a realistic case study, the problem of restoring missing accents in Spanish and French text.

Two groups of English and Chinese verbs are examined to show that lexical selection must be based on interpretation of the sentence as well as selection restrictions placed on the verb arguments. A novel representation scheme is suggested, and is compared to representations with selection restrictions used in transfer-based MT. We see our approach as closely aligned with knowledge-based MT approaches KBMT, and as a separate component that could be incorporated into existing systems. Examples and experimental results will show that, using this scheme, inexact matches can achieve correct lexical selection. ',\n",

       " ' Three studies of grammar-based surface-syntactic parsing of unrestricted English text. A summary and orientation The dissertation addresses the design of parsing grammars for automatic surface-syntactic analysis of unconstrained English text. It consists of a summary and three articles. {\\\\it Morphological disambiguation} documents a grammar for morphological (or part-of-speech) disambiguation of English, done within the Constraint Grammar framework proposed by Fred Karlsson. The disambiguator seeks to discard those of the alternative morphological analyses proposed by the lexical analyser that are contextually illegitimate. The 1,100 constraints express some 23 general, essentially syntactic statements as restrictions on the linear order of morphological tags. The error rate of the morphological disambiguator is about ten times smaller than that of another state-of-the-art probabilistic disambiguator, given that both are allowed to leave some of the hardest ambiguities unresolved. This accuracy suggests the viability of the grammar-based approach to natural language parsing, thus also contributing to the more general debate concerning the viability of probabilistic vs.\\\\ linguistic techniques. {\\\\it Experiments with heuristics} addresses the question of how to resolve those ambiguities that survive the morphological disambiguator. Two approaches are presented and empirically evaluated: (i) heuristic disambiguation constraints and (ii) techniques for learning from the fully disambiguated part of the corpus and then applying this information to resolving remaining ambiguities.

We experimentally evaluate these techniques, and show dramatic reductions in both number of chart-edges and total parsing time. The robust processing capabilities of the parser are demonstrated in its use in improving the accuracy of a speech recognizer. ',\n",

When making projections of error rates for systems of this kind, it is natural to assume that the error rates for the individual components are independent, making the system accuracy the product of the component accuracies. The paper reports experiments carried out using the SRI-SICS-Telia Research Spoken Language Translator and a 1000-utterance sample of unseen data. The results suggest that the naive performance model leads to serious overestimates of system error rates, since there are in fact strong dependencies between the components. Predicting the system error rate on the independence assumption by simple multiplication resulted in a 16\\\\% proportional overestimate for all utterances, and a 19\\\\% overestimate when only utterances of length 1-10 words were considered.

These units are called acoustic events and are phonologically meaningful as well as recognizable from speech signals. Acoustic events form a phonologically incomplete representation as compared to distinctive features. This problem may partly be overcome by incorporating phonological constraints. Currently, 24 binary events describing manner and place of articulation, vowel quality and voicing are used to recognize all German phonemes. Phoneme recognition in this paradigm consists of two steps: After the acoustic events have been determined from the speech signal, a phonological parser is used to generate syllable and phoneme hypotheses from the event lattice.

The interpretations of different word orders in Turkish rely on information that describes how a sentence relates to its discourse context. To capture the syntactic features of a free word order language, I present an adaptation of Combinatory Categorial Grammars called {}-CCGs (set-CCGs). In {}-CCGs, a verb's subcategorization requirements are relaxed so that it requires a set of arguments without specifying their linear order. I integrate a level of information structure, representing pragmatic functions such as topic and focus, with {}-CCGs to allow certain pragmatic distinctions in meaning to influence the word order of a sentence in a compositional way. Finally, I discuss how this strategy is used within an implemented generation system which produces Turkish sentences with context-appropriate word orders in a simple database query task. \",\n",
       " \" The Role of Cognitive Modeling in Achieving Communicative Intentions A discourse planner for (task-oriented) dialogue must be able to make choices about whether relevant, but optional information (for example, the satellites in an RST-based planner) should be communicated. We claim that effective text planners must explicitly model aspects of the Hearer's cognitive state, such as what the hearer is attending to and what inferences the hearer can draw, in order to make these choices. We argue that a mere representation of the Hearer's knowledge is inadequate. We support this claim by (1) an analysis of naturally occurring dialogue, and (2) by simulating the generation of discourses in a situation in which we can vary the cognitive parameters of the hearer. Our results show that modeling cognitive state can lead to more effective discourses (measured with respect to a simple task). \",\n",

       " \" Tracking Point of View in Narrative Third-person fictional narrative text is composed not only of passages that objectively narrate events, but also of passages that present characters' thoughts, perceptions, and inner states. Such passages take a character's ``psychological point of view''. A language understander must determine the current psychological point of view in order to distinguish the beliefs of the characters from the facts of the story, to correctly attribute beliefs and other attitudes to their sources, and to understand the discourse relations among sentences. Tracking the psychological point of view is not a trivial problem, because many sentences are not explicitly marked for point of view, and whether the point of view of a sentence is objective or that of a character (and if the latter, which character it is) often depends on the context in which the sentence appears. Tracking the psychological point of view is the problem addressed in this work. The approach is to seek, by extensive examinations of naturally-occurring narrative, regularities in the ways that authors manipulate point of view, and to develop an algorithm that tracks point of view on the basis of the regularities found. This paper presents this algorithm, gives demonstrations of an implemented system, and describes the results of some preliminary empirical studies, which lend support to the algorithm. \",\n",

The computational framework behind the current work is motivated by Kay (1987); the formalism presented here is an extension to the formalism reported by Pulman and Hepple (1993). The objectives of the current work are: to stay as close as possible, in spirit, to standard two-level morphology, to stay close to the linguistic description of Semitic stems, and to present a model which can be used with ease by the Semitist. The paper illustrates that if finite-state transducers (FSTs) in a standard two-level morphology model are replaced with multi-tape auxiliary versions (AFSTs), one can account for Semitic root-and-pattern morphology using high level notation.

By drawing upon both statistical and symbolic information, it constrains its repair hypotheses to those which are both likely and meaningful.

Most of this text must be postedited by hand before it sees the light of day. Improving text quality is tedious work, but its automation has not received much research attention. Anyone who has postedited a technical report or thesis written by a non-native speaker of English knows the potential of an automated postediting system. For the case of MT-generated text, we argue for the construction of postediting modules that are portable across MT systems, as an alternative to hardcoding improvements inside any one system. As an example, we have built a complete self-contained postediting module for the task of article selection (a, an, the) for English noun phrases. This is a notoriously difficult problem for Japanese-English MT. Our system contains over 200,000 rules derived automatically from online text resources.

       " ' Building a Large-Scale Knowledge Base for Machine Translation Knowledge-based machine translation KBMT systems have achieved excellent results in constrained domains, but have not yet scaled up to newspaper text. The reason is that knowledge resources (lexicons, grammar rules, world models) must be painstakingly handcrafted from scratch. One of the hypotheses being tested in the PANGLOSS machine translation project is whether or not these resources can be semi-automatically acquired on a very large scale. This paper focuses on the construction of a large ontology (or knowledge base, or world model) for supporting KBMT. It contains representations for some 70,000 commonly encountered objects, processes, qualities, and relations. The ontology was constructed by merging various online dictionaries, semantic networks, and bilingual resources, through semi-automatic methods. Some of these methods (e.g., conceptual matching of semantic taxonomies) are broadly applicable to problems of importing/exporting knowledge from one KB to another. Other methods (e.g., bilingual matching) allow a knowledge engineer to build up an index to a KB in a second language, such as Spanish or Japanese. ',\n",

       " ' Tagging and Morphological Disambiguation of Turkish Text Automatic text tagging is an important component in higher level analysis of text corpora, and its output can be used in many natural language processing applications. In languages like Turkish or Finnish, with agglutinative morphology, morphological disambiguation is a very crucial process in tagging, as the structures of many lexical forms are morphologically ambiguous. This paper describes a POS tagger for Turkish text based on a full-scale two-level specification of Turkish morphology that is based on a lexicon of about 24,000 root words. This is augmented with a multi-word and idiomatic construct recognizer, and most importantly morphological disambiguator based on local neighborhood constraints, heuristics and limited amount of statistical information. The tagger also has functionality for statistics compilation and fine tuning of the morphological analyzer, such as logging erroneous morphological parses, commonly used roots, etc. Preliminary results indicate that the tagger can tag about 98-99\\\\% of the texts accurately with very minimal user intervention. Furthermore for sentences morphologically disambiguated with the tagger, an LFG parser developed for Turkish, generates, on the average, 50\\\\% less ambiguous parses and parses almost 2.5 times faster. The tagging functionality is not specific to Turkish, and can be applied to any language with a proper morphological analysis interface. ',\n",

Oblique decision tree methods are tuned especially for domains in which the attributes are numeric, although they can be adapted to symbolic or mixed symbolic/numeric attributes. We present extensive empirical studies, using both real and artificial data, that analyze OC1's ability to construct oblique trees that are smaller and more accurate than their axis-parallel counterparts. We also examine the benefits of randomization for the construction of oblique decision trees. \",\n",
       " ' Pattern Matching and Discourse Processing in Information Extraction from Japanese Text Information extraction is the task of automatically picking up information of interest from an unconstrained text. Information of interest is usually extracted in two steps. First, sentence level processing locates relevant pieces of information scattered throughout the text; second, discourse processing merges coreferential information to generate the output. In the first step, pieces of information are locally identified without recognizing any relationships among them. A key word search or simple pattern search can achieve this purpose. The second step requires deeper knowledge in order to understand relationships among separately identified pieces of information. Previous information extraction systems focused on the first step, partly because they were not required to link up each piece of information with other pieces. To link the extracted pieces of information and map them onto a structured output format, complex discourse processing is essential. This paper reports on a Japanese information extraction system that merges information using a pattern matcher and discourse processor. Evaluation results show a high level of system performance which approaches human performance. ',\n",
       " ' Random Worlds and Maximum Entropy Given a knowledge base KB containing first-order and statistical facts, we consider a principled method, called the random-worlds method, for computing a degree of belief that some formula Phi holds given KB. If we are reasoning about a world or system consisting of N individuals, then we can consider all possible worlds, or first-order models, with domain {1,...,N} that satisfy KB, and compute the fraction of them in which Phi is true. We define the degree of belief to be the asymptotic value of this fraction as N grows large. We show that when the vocabulary underlying Phi and KB uses constants and unary predicates only, we can naturally associate an entropy with each world. As N grows larger, there are many more worlds with higher entropy. Therefore, we can use a maximum-entropy computation to compute the degree of belief. This result is in a similar spirit to previous work in physics and artificial intelligence, but is far more general. Of equal interest to the result itself are the limitations on its scope. Most importantly, the restriction to unary predicates seems necessary. Although the random-worlds method makes sense in general, the connection to maximum entropy seems to disappear in the non-unary case. These observations suggest unexpected limitations to the applicability of maximum-entropy methods. ',\n",

This simple account follows directly from our use of logical deduction in linear logic to express the relationship between syntactic structures and meanings. While our analysis resembles current categorial approaches in important ways, it differs from them in allowing the greater type flexibility of categorial semantics while maintaining a precise connection to syntax. As a result, we are able to provide derivations for certain readings of sentences with intensional verbs and complex direct objects that are not derivable in current purely categorial accounts of the syntax-semantics interface.

We consider these models within the context of two hypothetical speech translation systems, starting with a logic-based design and pointing out which of its characteristics are best preserved or eliminated in moving to the second, quantitative design. The quantitative language and translation models are based on relations between lexical heads of phrases. Statistical parameters for structural dependency, lexical transfer, and linear order are used to select a set of implicit relations between words in a source utterance, a corresponding set of relations between target language words, and the most likely translation of the original utterance.

       " ' Training and Scaling Preference Functions for Disambiguation We present an automatic method for weighting the contributions of preference functions used in disambiguation. Initial scaling factors are derived as the solution to a least-squares minimization problem, and improvements are then made by hill-climbing. The method is applied to disambiguating sentences in the ATIS (Air Travel Information System) corpus, and the performance of the resulting scaling factors is compared with hand-tuned factors. We then focus on one class of preference function, those based on semantic lexical collocations. Experimental results are presented showing that such functions vary considerably in selecting correct analyses. In particular we define a function that performs significantly better than ones based on mutual information and likelihood ratios of lexical associations. ',\n",

In this paper we show that there are communicative strategies that greatly improve the performance of resource-bounded agents, but that these strategies are highly sensitive to the task requirements, situation parameters and agents' resource limitations. We base our argument on two sources of evidence: (1) an analysis of a corpus of 55 problem solving dialogues, and (2) experimental simulations of collaborative problem solving dialogues in an experimental world, Design-World, where we parameterize task requirements, agents' resources and communicative strategies. \",\n",
       " ' Restricting the Weak-Generative Capacity of Synchronous Tree-Adjoining Grammars The formalism of synchronous tree-adjoining grammars, a variant of standard tree-adjoining grammars TAG, was intended to allow the use of TAGs for language transduction in addition to language specification. In previous work, the definition of the transduction relation defined by a synchronous TAG was given by appeal to an iterative rewriting process. The rewriting definition of derivation is problematic in that it greatly extends the expressivity of the formalism and makes the design of parsing algorithms difficult if not impossible. We introduce a simple, natural definition of synchronous tree-adjoining derivation, based on isomorphisms between standard tree-adjoining derivations, that avoids the expressivity and implementability problems of the original rewriting definition. The decrease in expressivity, which would otherwise make the method unusable, is offset by the incorporation of an alternative definition of standard tree-adjoining derivation, previously proposed for completely separate reasons, thereby making it practical to entertain using the natural definition of synchronous derivation. Nonetheless, some remaining problematic cases call for yet more flexibility in the definition; the isomorphism requirement may have to be relaxed. It remains for future research to tune the exact requirements on the allowable mappings. ',\n",
       " \" A Unified Process Model of Syntactic and Semantic Error Recovery in Sentence Understanding The development of models of human sentence processing has traditionally followed one of two paths. Either the model posited a sequence of processing modules, each with its own task-specific knowledge (e.g., syntax and semantics), or it posited a single processor utilizing different types of knowledge inextricably integrated into a monolithic knowledge base. Our previous work in modeling the sentence processor resulted in a model in which different processing modules used separate knowledge sources but operated in parallel to arrive at the interpretation of a sentence. One highlight of this model is that it offered an explanation of how the sentence processor might recover from an error in choosing the meaning of an ambiguous word. Recent experimental work by Laurie Stowe strongly suggests that the human sentence processor deals with syntactic error recovery using a mechanism very much like that proposed by our model of semantic error recovery. Another way to interpret Stowe's finding is this: the human sentence processor consists of a single unified processing module utilizing multiple independent knowledge sources in parallel. A sentence processor built upon this architecture should at times exhibit behavior associated with modular approaches, and at other times act like an integrated system. In this paper we explore some of these ideas via a prototype computational model of sentence processing called COMPERE, and propose a set of psychological experiments for testing our theories. \",\n",

Such a parser has been implemented in a sentence understanding program called COMPERE. ',\n",
       " ' Having Your Cake and Eating It Too: Autonomy and Interaction in a Model of Sentence Processing Is the human language understander a collection of modular processes operating with relative autonomy, or is it a single integrated process? This ongoing debate has polarized the language processing community, with two fundamentally different types of model posited, and with each camp concluding that the other is wrong. One camp puts forth a model with separate processors and distinct knowledge sources to explain one body of data, and the other proposes a model with a single processor and a homogeneous, monolithic knowledge source to explain the other body of data. In this paper we argue that a hybrid approach which combines a unified processor with separate knowledge sources provides an explanation of both bodies of data, and we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with the computational model called COMPERE. We believe that this approach brings the language processing community significantly closer to offering human-like language processing systems. ',\n",

As basis, the logical setups of Carpenter (1992) and King (1989, 1994) are briefly compared regarding their usefulness as basis for HPSGII (Pollard and Sag 1994). The possibilities for expressing HPSG theories in the HPSGII architecture and in various computational systems (ALE, Troll, CUF, and TFS) are discussed. Beside a formal characterization of the possibilities, the paper investigates the specific choices for constraints with certain linguistic motivations, i.e. the lexicon, structure licencing, and grammatical principles.

We discuss the tractability of various plan-design processes. We show that for a large natural class of Planning while Learning systems, a plan can be presented and verified in a reasonable time. However, coming up algorithmically with a plan, even for simple classes of systems is apparently intractable. We emphasize the role of off-line plan-design processes, and show that, in most natural cases, the verification (projection) part can be carried out in an efficient algorithmic manner. ',\n",
       " ' Reaping the Benefits of Interactive Syntax and Semantics Semantic feedback is an important source of information that a parser could use to deal with local ambiguities in syntax. However, it is difficult to devise a systematic communication mechanism for interactive syntax and semantics. In this article, I propose a variant of left-corner parsing to define the points at which syntax and semantics should interact, an account of grammatical relations and thematic roles to define the content of the communication, and a conflict resolution strategy based on independent preferences from syntax and semantics. The resulting interactive model has been implemented in a program called COMPERE and shown to account for a wide variety of psycholinguistic data on structural and lexical ambiguities. ',\n",
       " ' Uniform Representations for Syntax-Semantics Arbitration Psychological investigations have led to considerable insight into the working of the human language comprehension system. In this article, we look at a set of principles derived from psychological findings to argue for a particular organization of linguistic knowledge along with a particular processing strategy and present a computational model of sentence processing based on those principles. Many studies have shown that human sentence comprehension is an incremental and interactive process in which semantic and other higher-level information interacts with syntactic information to make informed commitments as early as possible at a local ambiguity. Early commitments may be made by using top-down guidance from knowledge of different types, each of which must be applicable independently of others. Further evidence from studies of error recovery and delayed decisions points toward an arbitration mechanism for combining syntactic and semantic information in resolving ambiguities. In order to account for all of the above, we propose that all types of linguistic knowledge must be represented in a common form but must be separable so that they can be applied independently of each other and integrated at processing time by the arbitrator. We present such a uniform representation and a computational model called COMPERE based on the representation and the processing strategy. ',\n",

In this paper we develop a probabilistic model for syntactically analysing such compounds. The model predicts compound noun structures based on knowledge of affinities between nouns, which can be acquired from a corpus. Problems inherent in this corpus-based approach are addressed: data sparseness is overcome by the use of semantically motivated word classes and sense ambiguity is explicitly handled in the model.

       " ' Parsing of Spoken Language under Time Constraints Spoken language applications in natural dialogue settings place serious requirements on the choice of processing architecture. Especially under adverse phonetic and acoustic conditions parsing procedures have to be developed which do not only analyse the incoming speech in a time-synchroneous and incremental manner, but which are able to schedule their resources according to the varying conditions of the recognition process. Depending on the actual degree of local ambiguity the parser has to select among the available constraints in order to narrow down the search space with as little effort as possible. A parsing approach based on constraint satisfaction techniques is discussed. It provides important characteristics of the desired real-time behaviour and attempts to mimic some of the attention focussing capabilities of the human speech comprehension mechanism. ',\n",
       " \" Inducing Probabilistic Grammars by Bayesian Model Merging We describe a framework for inducing probabilistic grammars from corpora of positive samples. First, samples are {\\\\em incorporated} by adding ad-hoc rules to a working grammar; subsequently, elements of the model (such as states or nonterminals) are {\\\\em merged} to achieve generalization and a more compact representation. The choice of what to merge and when to stop is governed by the Bayesian posterior probability of the grammar given the data, which formalizes a trade-off between a close fit to the data and a default preference for simpler models (`Occam's Razor'). The general scheme is illustrated using three types of probabilistic grammars: Hidden Markov models, class-based grams, and stochastic context-free grammars. \",\n",

The processors can become faulty while in operation and faulty processors never recover. A report is issued whenever a fault occurs. This report states only the existence of a fault, but does not indicate its location. Based on this report, the scheduler can reconfigure the system and choose another set of processors. The system operates satisfactorily as long as at most of the selected processors are faulty. We exhibit a scheduling strategy allowing the system to operate satisfactorily until approximately faults are reported in the worst case. Our precise bound is tight. ',\n",

In this paper, we present a general methodology to prove correctness statements of such randomized algorithms. Specifically, we show how to prove such statements by a series of refinements, which terminate in a statement independent of the schedule. To demonstrate the subtlety of the issues involved in this type of analysis, we focus on Rabin's randomized distributed algorithm for mutual exclusion [Rabin 82]. Surprisingly, it turns out that the algorithm does not maintain one of the requirements of the problem under a certain schedule. In particular, we give a schedule under which a set of processes can suffer lockout for arbitrary long periods. \",\n",

This is a type of on-line problem where a strategy must exploit {\\\\em partial information \\\\/} about the future (e.g., about obstacles that lie ahead).

A key idea of the paper is that a {\\\\em tree\\\\/} structure can be defined in the scene, where the nodes are portions of certain obstacles and the edges are ``short'' paths from a node to its children. The core of our algorithms is an on-line strategy for traversing this tree optimally. \",\n",

We also present an on-line coloring heuristic which achieves a competitive ratio of 6 for unit disk graphs. Our heuristics do not need a geometric representation of unit disk graphs. Geometric representations are used only in establishing the performance guarantees of the heuristics.

We present polynomial time approximation algorithms for several standard PSPACE-hard problems considered in the literature.

       " ' Improving Language Models by Clustering Training Sentences Many of the kinds of language model used in speech understanding suffer from imperfect modeling of intra-sentential contextual influences. I argue that this problem can be addressed by clustering the sentences in a training corpus automatically into subcorpora on the criterion of entropy reduction, and calculating separate language model parameters for each cluster. This kind of clustering offers a way to represent important contextual effects and can therefore significantly improve the performance of a model. It also offers a reasonably automatic means to gather evidence on whether a more complex, context-sensitive model using the same general kind of linguistic information is likely to reward the effort that would be required to develop it: if clustering improves the performance of a model, this proves the existence of further context dependencies, not exploited by the unclustered model. As evidence for these claims, I present results showing that clustering improves some models but not others for the ATIS domain. These results are consistent with other findings for such models, suggesting that the existence or otherwise of an improvement brought about by clustering is indeed a good pointer to whether it is worth developing further the unclustered model.

       " ' Principle Based Semantics for HPSG The paper presents a constraint based semantic formalism for HPSG. The advantages of the formlism are shown with respect to a grammar for a fragment of German that deals with (i) quantifier scope ambiguities triggered by scrambling and/or movement and (ii) ambiguities that arise from the collective/distributive distinction of plural NPs. The syntax-semantics interface directly implements syntactic conditions on quantifier scoping and distributivity. The construction of semantic representations is guided by general principles governing the interaction between syntax and semantics. Each of these principles acts as a constraint to narrow down the set of possible interpretations of a sentence. Meanings of ambiguous sentences are represented by single partial representations (so-called U(nderspecified) D(iscourse) R(epresentation) S(tructure)s) to which further constraints can be added monotonically to gain more information about the content of a sentence. There is no need to build up a large number of alternative representations of the sentence which are then filtered by subsequent discourse and world knowledge. The advantage of UDRSs is not only that they allow for monotonic incremental interpretation but also that they are equipped with truth conditions and a proof theory that allows for inferences to be drawn directly on structures where quantifier scope is not resolved.

The resulting dictionary is a word-to-word bilingual dictionary of nouns and can be used to refine the entries and equivalencies in published bilingual dictionaries. ',\n",
       " ' Does Baum-Welch Re-estimation Help Taggers? In part of speech tagging by Hidden Markov Model, a statistical model is used to assign grammatical categories to words in a text. Early work in the field relied on a corpus which had been tagged by a human annotator to train the model. More recently, Cutting {\\\\it et al.} (1992) suggest that training can be achieved with a minimal lexicon and a limited amount of {\\\\em a priori} information about probabilities, by using Baum-Welch re-estimation to automatically refine the model. In this paper, I report two experiments designed to determine how much manual training information is needed. The first experiment suggests that initial biasing of either lexical or transition probabilities is essential to achieve a good accuracy. The second experiment reveals that there are three distinct patterns of Baum-Welch re-estimation. In two of the patterns, the re-estimation ultimately reduces the accuracy of the tagging rather than improving it. The pattern which is applicable can be predicted from the quality of the initial model and the similarity between the tagged training corpus (if any) and the corpus to be tagged. Heuristics for deciding how to use re-estimation in an effective manner are given. The conclusions are broadly in agreement with those of Merialdo (1994), but give greater detail about the contributions of different parts of the model. ',\n",

       " ' Korean to English Translation Using Synchronous TAGs It is often argued that accurate machine translation requires reference to contextual knowledge for the correct treatment of linguistic phenomena such as dropped arguments and accurate lexical selection. One of the historical arguments in favor of the interlingua approach has been that, since it revolves around a deep semantic representation, it is better able to handle the types of linguistic phenomena that are seen as requiring a knowledge-based approach. In this paper we present an alternative approach, exemplified by a prototype system for machine translation of English and Korean which is implemented in Synchronous TAGs. This approach is essentially transfer based, and uses semantic feature unification for accurate lexical selection of polysemous verbs. The same semantic features, when combined with a discourse model which stores previously mentioned entities, can also be used for the recovery of topicalized arguments. In this paper we concentrate on the translation of Korean to English. ',\n",

The proposed model is intended to serve as a tool for phonologists working on instrumentally obtained pitch data from tone languages. Motivation and exemplification for the model is provided by data taken from my fieldwork on Bamileke Dschang (Cameroon). Following recent work by Liberman and others, I provide a parametrised F_0 prediction function P which generates F_0 values from a tone sequence, and I explore the asymptotic behaviour of downstep. Next, I observe that transcribing a sequence X of pitch (i.e. F_0) values amounts to finding a tone sequence T such that P(T) {}~= X. This is a combinatorial optimisation problem, for which two non-deterministic search techniques are provided: a genetic algorithm and a simulated annealing algorithm. Finally, two implementations---one for each technique---are described and then compared using both artificial and real data for sequences of up to 20 tones. These programs can be adapted to other tone languages by adjusting the F_0 prediction function. ',\n",

We present techniques for disambiguating supertags using local information such as lexical preference and local lexical dependencies. The similarity between LTAG and Dependency grammars is exploited in the dependency model of supertag disambiguation. The performance results for various models of supertag disambiguation such as unigram, trigram and dependency-based models are presented. ',\n",

The deleted estimation method uses the formula: Pr(i|j) = lambda f_i + (1-lambda)f_i|j, where f_i and f_i|j are the relative frequency of i and the conditional relative frequency of i given j, respectively, and lambda is an optimized parameter. MacKay (1994) proposes a Bayesian approach using Dirichlet priors, which yields a different formula: Pr(i|j) = (alpha/F_j + alpha) m_i + (1 - alpha/F_j + alpha) f_i|j where F_j is the count of j and alpha and m_i are optimized parameters. This thesis describes an experiment in which the two methods were trained on a two-million-word corpus taken from the Canadian _Hansard_ and compared on the basis of the experimental perplexity that they assigned to a shared test corpus. The methods proved to be about equally accurate, with MacKay's method using fewer resources. \",\n",

To our knowledge there have been no attempts to construct a large-scale CCG parser with the lexicon to support it. In this paper, we describe such a system, built by adapting various XTAG components to CCG.

       " \" Constraining Lexical Selection Across Languages Using TAGs Lexical selection in Machine Translation consists of several related components. Two that have received a lot of attention are lexical mapping from an underlying concept or lexical item, and choosing the correct subcategorization frame based on argument structure. Because most MT applications are small or relatively domain specific, a third component of lexical selection is generally overlooked - distinguishing between lexical items that are closely related conceptually. While some MT systems have proposed using a 'world knowledge' module to decide which word is more appropriate based on various pragmatic or stylistic constraints, we are interested in seeing how much we can accomplish using a combination of syntax and lexical semantics. By using separate ontologies for each language implemented in FB-LTAGs, we are able to elegantly model the more specific and language dependent syntactic and semantic distinctions necessary to further filter the choice of the lexical item. \",\n",

We contrast this approach with approaches based on a single type hierarchy where a feature structure has only one unique most general type, and multiple inheritance involves computation of greatest lower bounds in the hierarchy. The proposed approach supports current linguistic analyses in constraint-based formalisms like HPSG, inheritance in the lexicon, and knowledge representation for NLP systems.

Two standard algorithm schemas for learning are reviewed in a graphical framework: Gibbs sampling and the expectation maximization algorithm. Using these operations and schemas, some popular algorithms can be synthesized from their graphical specification. This includes versions of linear regression, techniques for feed-forward networks, and learning Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks from data. The paper concludes by sketching some implications for data analysis and summarizing how some popular algorithms fall within the framework presented. The main original contributions here are the decomposition techniques and the demonstration that graphical models provide a framework for understanding and developing complex learning algorithms.

       " ' Total-Order and Partial-Order Planning: A Comparative Analysis For many years, the intuitions underlying partial-order planning were largely taken for granted. Only in the past few years has there been renewed interest in the fundamental principles underlying this paradigm. In this paper, we present a rigorous comparative analysis of partial-order and total-order planning by focusing on two specific planners that can be directly compared. We show that there are some subtle assumptions that underly the wide-spread intuitions regarding the supposed efficiency of partial-order planning. For instance, the superiority of partial-order planning can depend critically upon the search strategy and the structure of the search space. Understanding the underlying assumptions is crucial for constructing efficient planners. ',\n",
       " ' Wrap-Up: a Trainable Discourse Module for Information Extraction The vast amounts of on-line text now available have led to renewed interest in information extraction IE systems that analyze unrestricted text, producing a structured representation of selected information from the text. This paper presents a novel approach that uses machine learning to acquire knowledge for some of the higher level IE processing. Wrap-Up is a trainable IE discourse component that makes intersentential inferences and identifies logical relations among information extracted from the text. Previous corpus-based approaches were limited to lower level processing such as part-of-speech tagging, lexical disambiguation, and dictionary construction. Wrap-Up is fully trainable, and not only automatically decides what classifiers are needed, but even derives the feature set for each classifier automatically. Performance equals that of a partially trainable discourse module requiring manual customization for each domain. ',\n",
       " ' Dependency Grammar and the Parsing of Chinese Sentences Dependency Grammar has been used by linguists as the basis of the syntactic components of their grammar formalisms. It has also been used in natural language parsing. In China, attempts have been made to use this grammar formalism to parse Chinese sentences using corpus-based techniques. This paper reviews the properties of Dependency Grammar as embodied in four axioms for the well-formedness conditions for dependency structures. It is shown that allowing multiple governors as done by some followers of this formalism is unnecessary. The practice of augmenting Dependency Grammar with functional labels is also discussed in the light of building functional structures when the sentence is parsed. This will also facilitate semantic interpretation. ',\n",

       " \" An Extended Clustering Algorithm for Statistical Language Models Statistical language models frequently suffer from a lack of training data. This problem can be alleviated by clustering, because it reduces the number of free parameters that need to be trained. However, clustered models have the following drawback: if there is ``enough'' data to train an unclustered model, then the clustered variant may perform worse. On currently used language modeling corpora, e.g. the Wall Street Journal corpus, how do the performances of a clustered and an unclustered model compare? While trying to address this question, we develop the following two ideas. First, to get a clustering algorithm with potentially high performance, an existing algorithm is extended to deal with higher order N-grams. Second, to make it possible to cluster large amounts of training data more efficiently, a heuristic to speed up the algorithm is presented. The resulting clustering algorithm can be used to cluster trigrams on the Wall Street Journal corpus and the language models it produces can compete with existing back-off models. Especially when there is only little training data available, the clustered models clearly outperform the back-off models. \",\n",
       " ' Knowledge Representation for Lexical Semantics: Is Standard First Order Logic Enough? Natural language understanding applications such as interactive planning and face-to-face translation require extensive inferencing. Many of these inferences are based on the meaning of particular open class words. Providing a representation that can support such lexically-based inferences is a primary concern of lexical semantics. The representation language of first order logic has well-understood semantics and a multitude of inferencing systems have been implemented for it. Thus it is a prime candidate to serve as a lexical semantics representation. However, we argue that FOL, although a good starting point, needs to be extended before it can efficiently and concisely support all the lexically-based inferences needed. ',\n",
       " ' Segmenting speech without a lexicon: The roles of phonotactics and speech source Infants face the difficult problem of segmenting continuous speech into words without the benefit of a fully developed lexicon. Several sources of information in speech might help infants solve this problem, including prosody, semantic correlations and phonotactics. Research to date has focused on determining to which of these sources infants might be sensitive, but little work has been done to determine the potential usefulness of each source. The computer simulations reported here are a first attempt to measure the usefulness of distributional and phonotactic information in segmenting phoneme sequences. The algorithms hypothesize different segmentations of the input into words and select the best hypothesis according to the Minimum Description Length principle. Our results indicate that while there is some useful information in both phoneme distributions and phonotactic rules, the combination of both sources is most useful. ',\n",

The initial (meta)grammar is defined by a linguist and further rules compatible with metagrammatical constraints are automatically generated. During training, rules with very low probability are rejected yielding a wide-coverage parser capable of ranking alternative analyses.

       " ' Coupling Phonology and Phonetics in a Constraint-Based Gestural Model An implemented approach which couples a constraint-based phonology component with an articulatory speech synthesizer is proposed. Articulatory gestures ensure a tight connection between both components, as they comprise both physical-phonetic and phonological aspects. The phonological modelling of e.g. syllabification and phonological processes such as German final devoicing is expressed in the constraint logic programming language CUF. Extending CUF by arithmetic constraints allows the simultaneous description of both phonology and phonetics. Thus declarative lexicalist theories of grammar such as HPSG may be enriched up to the level of detailed phonetic realisation. Initial acoustic demonstrations show that our approach is in principle capable of synthesizing full utterances in a linguistically motivated fashion. ',\n",

An experiment is conducted with 160,000 word collocations to analyze compound nouns of with an average length of 4.9 characters. The accuracy of this method is about 80%. ',\n",
       " \" A Domain-Independent Algorithm for Plan Adaptation The paradigms of transformational planning, case-based planning, and plan debugging all involve a process known as plan adaptation - modifying or repairing an old plan so it solves a new problem. In this paper we provide a domain-independent algorithm for plan adaptation, demonstrate that it is sound, complete, and systematic, and compare it to other adaptation algorithms in the literature. Our approach is based on a view of planning as searching a graph of partial plans. Generative planning starts at the graph's root and moves from node to node using plan-refinement operators. In planning by adaptation, a library plan - an arbitrary node in the plan graph - is the starting point for the search, and the plan-adaptation algorithm can apply both the same refinement operators available to a generative planner and can also retract constraints and steps from the plan. Our algorithm's completeness ensures that the adaptation algorithm will eventually search the entire graph and its systematicity ensures that it will do so without redundantly searching any parts of the graph. \",\n",
       " \" Solving Multiclass Learning Problems via Error-Correcting Output Codes Multiclass learning problems involve finding a definition for an unknown function f(x) whose range is a discrete set containing k &gt 2 values (i.e., k ``classes''). The definition is acquired by studying collections of training examples of the form [x_i, f (x_i)]. Existing approaches to multiclass learning problems include direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the decision-tree algorithms C4.5 and CART, application of binary concept learning algorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and application of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output representations. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique in which error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output representation. We show that these output representations improve the generalization performance of both C4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range of multiclass learning tasks. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust with respect to changes in the size of the training sample, the assignment of distributed representations to particular classes, and the application of overfitting avoidance techniques such as decision-tree pruning. Finally, we show that---like the other methods---the error-correcting code technique can provide reliable class probability estimates. Taken together, these results demonstrate that error-correcting output codes provide a general-purpose method for improving the performance of inductive learning programs on multiclass problems. \",\n",
       " ' Truncating Temporal Differences: On the Efficient Implementation of TD(lambda) for Reinforcement Learning Temporal difference TD methods constitute a class of methods for learning predictions in multi-step prediction problems, parameterized by a recency factor lambda. Currently the most important application of these methods is to temporal credit assignment in reinforcement learning. Well known reinforcement learning algorithms, such as AHC or Q-learning, may be viewed as instances of TD learning. This paper examines the issues of the efficient and general implementation of TD(lambda) for arbitrary lambda, for use with reinforcement learning algorithms optimizing the discounted sum of rewards. The traditional approach, based on eligibility traces, is argued to suffer from both inefficiency and lack of generality. The TTD (Truncated Temporal Differences) procedure is proposed as an alternative, that indeed only approximates TD(lambda), but requires very little computation per action and can be used with arbitrary function representation methods. The idea from which it is derived is fairly simple and not new, but probably unexplored so far. Encouraging experimental results are presented, suggesting that using lambda &gt 0 with the TTD procedure allows one to obtain a significant learning speedup at essentially the same cost as usual TD(0) learning.

       " \" Using default inheritance to describe LTAG We present the results of an investigation into how the set of elementary trees of a Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar can be represented in the lexical knowledge representation language DATR (Evans & Gazdar 1989a,b). The LTAG under consideration is based on the one described in Abeille et al. (1990). Our approach is similar to that of Vijay-Shanker & Schabes (1992) in that we formulate an inheritance hierarchy that efficiently encodes the elementary trees. However, rather than creating a new representation formalism for this task, we employ techniques of established utility in other lexically-oriented frameworks. In particular, we show how DATR's default mechanism can be used to eliminate the need for a non-immediate dominance relation in the descriptions of the surface LTAG entries. This allows us to embed the tree structures in the feature theory in a manner reminiscent of HPSG subcategorisation frames, and hence express lexical rules as relations over feature structures. \",\n",
       " ' NL Understanding with a Grammar of Constructions We present an approach to natural language understanding based on a computable grammar of constructions. A construction consists of a set of features of form and a description of meaning in a context. A grammar is a set of constructions. This kind of grammar is the key element of Mincal, an implemented natural language, speech-enabled interface to an on-line calendar system. The system consists of a NL grammar, a parser, an on-line calendar, a domain knowledge base (about dates, times and meetings), an application knowledge base (about the calendar), a speech recognizer, a speech generator, and the interfaces between those modules. We claim that this architecture should work in general for spoken interfaces in small domains. In this paper we present two novel aspects of the architecture: (a) the use of constructions, integrating descriptions of form, meaning and context into one whole; and (b) the separation of domain knowledge from application knowledge. We describe the data structures for encoding constructions, the structure of the knowledge bases, and the interactions of the key modules of the system. ',\n",

       " \" Learning Unification-Based Natural Language Grammars When parsing unrestricted language, wide-covering grammars often undergenerate. Undergeneration can be tackled either by sentence correction, or by grammar correction. This thesis concentrates upon automatic grammar correction (or machine learning of grammar) as a solution to the problem of undergeneration. Broadly speaking, grammar correction approaches can be classified as being either {\\\\it data-driven}, or {\\\\it model-based}. Data-driven learners use data-intensive methods to acquire grammar. They typically use grammar formalisms unsuited to the needs of practical text processing and cannot guarantee that the resulting grammar is adequate for subsequent semantic interpretation. That is, data-driven learners acquire grammars that generate strings that humans would judge to be grammatically ill-formed (they {\\\\it overgenerate}) and fail to assign linguistically plausible parses. Model-based learners are knowledge-intensive and are reliant for success upon the completeness of a {\\\\it model of grammaticality}. But in practice, the model will be incomplete. Given that in this thesis we deal with undergeneration by learning, we hypothesise that the combined use of data-driven and model-based learning would allow data-driven learning to compensate for model-based learning's incompleteness, whilst model-based learning would compensate for data-driven learning's unsoundness. We describe a system that we have used to test the hypothesis empirically. The system combines data-driven and model-based learning to acquire unification-based grammars that are more suitable for practical text parsing. Using the Spoken English Corpus as data, and by quantitatively measuring undergeneration, overgeneration and parse plausibility, we show that this hypothesis is correct. \",\n",
       " ' Bottom-Up Earley Deduction We propose a bottom-up variant of Earley deduction. Bottom-up deduction is preferable to top-down deduction because it allows incremental processing (even for head-driven grammars), it is data-driven, no subsumption check is needed, and preference values attached to lexical items can be used to guide best-first search. We discuss the scanning step for bottom-up Earley deduction and indexing schemes that help avoid useless deduction steps. ',\n",

ProFIT allows the programmer or grammar developer to declare an inheritance hierarchy, features and templates.

ProFIT compiles all sorted feature terms into a Prolog term representation, so that the built-in Prolog term unification can be used for the unification of sorted feature structures, and no special unification algorithm is needed. ProFIT programs are compiled into Prolog programs, so that no meta-interpreter is needed for their execution. ProFIT thus provides a direct step from grammars developed with sorted feature terms to Prolog programs usable for practical NLP systems. ',\n",

Extensive testing with a large HPSG grammar revealed some important constraints on the form of the grammar. ',\n",

The compiler is optimized for a class of languages including many or most European ones, and for rapid development and debugging of descriptions of new languages. The key design decision is to compose morphophonological and morphosyntactic information, but not the lexicon, when compiling the description.

While a parsing grammar should avoid introducing structurally unresolvable distinctions in order to optimise on the accuracy of the parser, it also is beneficial for the grammarian to have as expressive a structural representation available as possible. In a reductionistic parsing system this policy may result in considerable ambiguity in the input; however, even massive ambiguity can be tackled efficiently with an accurate parsing description and effective parsing technology.

In this article we report on a double-blind experiment with a surface-oriented morphosyntactic grammatical representation used in a large-scale English parser. We argue that a consistently applicable representation for morphology and also shallow syntax can be specified.

We provide an extension to the previous account of LFG semantics (Dalrymple et al., 1993b) according to which dependencies between f-structures are viewed as resources; as a result a one-to-one correspondence between uses of f-structures and meanings is maintained. The resulting system is sufficiently restricted in cases where other approaches overgenerate; the very property of resource-sensitivity for which resource sharing appears to be problematic actually provides explanatory advantages over systems that more freely replicate resources during derivation.

Recent state-of-the-art part-of-speech taggers are based on the data-driven approach. Because of the known feasibility of the linguistic rule-based approach at related levels of description, the success of the data-driven approach in part-of-speech analysis may appear surprising. In this paper, a case is made for the syntactic nature of part-of-speech tagging. A new tagger of English that uses only linguistic distributional rules is outlined and empirically evaluated. Tested against a benchmark corpus of 38,000 words of previously unseen text, this syntax-based system reaches an accuracy of above 99%. Compared to the 95-97% accuracy of its best competitors, this result suggests the feasibility of the linguistic approach also in part-of-speech analysis. ',\n",

A solution to the problem of the nonlocal flow of information in unification ID/LP grammars as discussed in Seiffert (1991) is incorporated into the algorithm. At the same time, it tries to connect this technical work with linguistics by presenting an example of the problem resulting from HPSG approaches to linguistics (Hinrichs and Nakasawa 1994, Richter and Sailer 1995) and with computational linguistics by drawing connections from this approach to systems implementing HPSG, especially the TROLL system, Gerdemann et al.

The method for building up the temporal structure of the discourse combines constraints and preferences: we use constraints to reduce the number of possible structures, exploiting the HPSG type hierarchy and unification for this purpose; and we apply preferences to choose between the remaining options using a temporal centering mechanism.

       " ' Principle Based Semantics for HPSG The paper presents a constraint based semantic formalism for HPSG. The syntax-semantics interface directly implements syntactic conditions on quantifier scoping and distributivity. The construction of semantic representations is guided by general principles governing the interaction between syntax and semantics. Each of these principles acts as a constraint to narrow down the set of possible interpretations of a sentence. Meanings of ambiguous sentences are represented by single partial representations (so-called U(nderspecified) D(iscourse) R(epresentation) S(tructure)s) to which further constraints can be added monotonically to gain more information about the content of a sentence. There is no need to build up a large number of alternative representations of the sentence which are then filtered by subsequent discourse and world knowledge. The advantage of UDRSs is not only that they allow for monotonic incremental interpretation but also that they are equipped with truth conditions and a proof theory that allows for inferences to be drawn directly on structures where quantifier scope is not resolved.

These texts deal with a relatively circumscribed domain, that of road traffic, thereby limiting the extra-linguistic knowledge necessary to understand them. Moreover, these texts present a number of very specific characteristics, insofar as they are written in a quasi-institutional setting which imposes many constraints on their production.

The system KEMDT (Korean/English Memory-based Dialog Translation system) can perform Korean to English, and English to Korean translation using unified memory network and extended marker passing algorithm. We resolve the word order variation and frequent word omission problems in Korean by classifying the concept sequence element in four different types and extending the marker- passing-based-translation algorithm. Unlike the previous memory-based translation systems, the KEMDT system develops the bilingual memory network and the unified bi-directional marker passing translation algorithm.

We tackle this issue, proposing an algorithm to co-ordinate the treatment of these two problems efficiently, i.e., the aim is also to exploit at each step all the results that each component can provide.

       " \" Cost-Sensitive Classification: Empirical Evaluation of a Hybrid Genetic Decision Tree Induction Algorithm This paper introduces ICET, a new algorithm for cost-sensitive classification. ICET uses a genetic algorithm to evolve a population of biases for a decision tree induction algorithm. The fitness function of the genetic algorithm is the average cost of classification when using the decision tree, including both the costs of tests (features, measurements) and the costs of classification errors. ICET is compared here with three other algorithms for cost-sensitive classification - EG2, CS-ID3, and IDX - and also with C4.5, which classifies without regard to cost. The five algorithms are evaluated empirically on five real-world medical datasets. Three sets of experiments are performed. The first set examines the baseline performance of the five algorithms on the five datasets and establishes that ICET performs significantly better than its competitors. The second set tests the robustness of ICET under a variety of conditions and shows that ICET maintains its advantage. The third set looks at ICET's search in bias space and discovers a way to improve the search. \",\n",
       " ' On the Informativeness of the DNA Promoter Sequences Domain Theory The DNA promoter sequences domain theory and database have become popular for testing systems that integrate empirical and analytical learning. This note reports a simple change and reinterpretation of the domain theory in terms of M-of-N concepts, involving no learning, that results in an accuracy of 93.4% on the 106 items of the database. Moreover, an exhaustive search of the space of M-of-N domain theory interpretations indicates that the expected accuracy of a randomly chosen interpretation is 76.5%, and that a maximum accuracy of 97.2% is achieved in 12 cases. This demonstrates the informativeness of the domain theory, without the complications of understanding the interactions between various learning algorithms and the theory. In addition, our results help characterize the difficulty of learning using the DNA promoters theory. ',\n",
       " ' Computational dialectology in Irish Gaelic Dialect groupings can be discovered objectively and automatically by cluster analysis of phonetic transcriptions such as those found in a linguistic atlas. The first step in the analysis, the computation of linguistic distance between each pair of sites, can be computed as Levenshtein distance between phonetic strings. This correlates closely with the much more laborious technique of determining and counting isoglosses, and is more accurate than the more familiar metric of computing Hamming distance based on whether vocabulary entries match. In the actual clustering step, traditional agglomerative clustering works better than the top-down technique of partitioning around medoids. When agglomerative clustering of phonetic string comparison distances is applied to Gaelic, reasonable dialect boundaries are obtained, corresponding to national and (within Ireland) provincial boundaries.

We describe the two systems and compare the results. The accuracy of the statistical method is reasonably good, comparable to taggers for English. But the constraint-based tagger seems to be superior even with the limited time we allowed ourselves for rule development. ',\n",

It predicts correctly a wide range of interactions between ellipsis and other semantic phenomena such as quantifier scope and bound anaphora. Finally, although the analysis itself is stated nonprocedurally, it admits of a direct computational method for generating interpretations. ',\n",

Letters (73:2, 5 Dec. 94), Mantegna et al. conclude on the basis of Zipf rank frequency data that noncoding DNA sequence regions are more like natural languages than coding regions. We argue on the contrary that an empirical fit to Zipf's ``law'' cannot be used as a criterion for similarity to natural languages. Although DNA is a presumably an ``organized system of signs'' in Mandelbrot's (1961) sense, an observation of statistical features of the sort presented in the Mantegna et al. paper does not shed light on the similarity between DNA's ``grammar'' and natural language grammars, just as the observation of exact Zipf-like behavior cannot distinguish between the underlying processes of tossing an sided die or a finite-state branching process. \",\n",
       " ' Corpus-based Method for Automatic Identification of Support Verbs for Nominalizations Nominalization is a highly productive phenomena in most languages. The process of nominalization ejects a verb from its syntactic role into a nominal position. The original verb is often replaced by a semantically emptied support verb (e.g., make a proposal ). The choice of a support verb for a given nominalization is unpredictable, causing a problem for language learners as well as for natural language processing systems. We present here a method of discovering support verbs from an untagged corpus via low-level syntactic processing and comparison of arguments attached to verbal forms and potential nominalized forms. The result of the process is a list of potential support verbs for the nominalized form of a given predicate. ',\n",
       " ' Improving Statistical Language Model Performance with Automatically Generated Word Hierarchies An automatic word classification system has been designed which processes word unigram and bigram frequency statistics extracted from a corpus of natural language utterances. The system implements a binary top-down form of word clustering which employs an average class mutual information metric. Resulting classifications are hierarchical, allowing variable class granularity. Words are represented as structural tags --- unique bit numbers the most significant bit-patterns of which incorporate class information. Access to a structural tag immediately provides access to all classification levels for the corresponding word. The classification system has successfully revealed some of the structure of English, from the phonemic to the semantic level. The system has been compared --- directly and indirectly --- with other recent word classification systems. Class based interpolated language models have been constructed to exploit the extra information supplied by the classifications and some experiments have shown that the new models improve model performance.

       " \" Multilingual Sentence Categorization according to Language In this paper, we describe an approach to sentence categorization which has the originality to be based on natural properties of languages with no training set dependency. The implementation is fast, small, robust and textual errors tolerant. Tested for french, english, spanish and german discrimination, the system gives very interesting results, achieving in one test 99.4% correct assignments on real sentences. The resolution power is based on grammatical words (not the most common words) and alphabet. Having the grammatical words and the alphabet of each language at its disposal, the system computes for each of them its likelihood to be selected. The name of the language having the optimum likelihood will tag the sentence --- but non resolved ambiguities will be maintained. We will discuss the reasons which lead us to use these linguistic facts and present several directions to improve the system's classification performance. Categorization sentences with linguistic properties shows that difficult problems have sometimes simple solutions. \",\n",

In recent years psycholinguistic evidence for incremental interpretation has become more and more compelling, suggesting that humans perform semantic interpretation before constituent boundaries, possibly word by word. However, possible computational applications have received less attention. In this paper we consider various potential applications, in particular graphical interaction and dialogue. We then review the theoretical and computational tools available for mapping from fragments of sentences to fully scoped semantic representations. Finally, we tease apart the relationship between dynamic semantics and incremental interpretation. ',\n",

A brief overview of the history of NLIDBs is first given. Some advantages and disadvantages of NLIDBs are then discussed, comparing NLIDBs to formal query languages, form-based interfaces, and graphical interfaces. An introduction to some of the linguistic problems NLIDBs have to confront follows, for the benefit of readers less familiar with computational linguistics. The discussion then moves on to NLIDB architectures, portability issues, restricted natural language input systems (including menu-based NLIDBs), and NLIDBs with reasoning capabilities. Some less explored areas of NLIDB research are then presented, namely database updates, meta-knowledge questions, temporal questions, and multi-modal NLIDBs. The paper ends with reflections on the current state of the art. ',\n",
       " \" Redundancy in Collaborative Dialogue In dialogues in which both agents are autonomous, each agent deliberates whether to accept or reject the contributions of the current speaker. A speaker cannot simply assume that a proposal or an assertion will be accepted. However, an examination of a corpus of naturally-occurring problem-solving dialogues shows that agents often do not explicitly indicate acceptance or rejection. Rather the speaker must infer whether the hearer understands and accepts the current contribution based on indirect evidence provided by the hearer's next dialogue contribution. In this paper, I propose a model of the role of informationally redundant utterances in providing evidence to support inferences about mutual understanding and acceptance. The model (1) requires a theory of mutual belief that supports mutual beliefs of various strengths; (2) explains the function of a class of informationally redundant utterances that cannot be explained by other accounts; and (3) contributes to a theory of dialogue by showing how mutual beliefs can be inferred in the absence of the master-slave assumption. \",\n",

We show that from these complexity results no immediate conclusions can be drawn about the complexity of the recognition problem of unification grammars using these feature theories. On the one hand, the complexity of feature theories does not provide an upper bound for the complexity of such unification grammars. On the other hand, the complexity of feature theories need not provide a lower bound. Therefore, we argue for formalisms that describe actual unification grammars instead of feature theories. Thus the complexity results of these formalisms judge upon the hardness of unification grammars in computational linguistics. ',\n",

As a result, we believe that the paper clarifies the concept of compositionality and opens a possibility of making systematic formal comparisons of different systems of grammars. ',\n",
       " ' Rerepresenting and Restructuring Domain Theories: A Constructive Induction Approach Theory revision integrates inductive learning and background knowledge by combining training examples with a coarse domain theory to produce a more accurate theory. There are two challenges that theory revision and other theory-guided systems face. First, a representation language appropriate for the initial theory may be inappropriate for an improved theory. While the original representation may concisely express the initial theory, a more accurate theory forced to use that same representation may be bulky, cumbersome, and difficult to reach. Second, a theory structure suitable for a coarse domain theory may be insufficient for a fine-tuned theory. Systems that produce only small, local changes to a theory have limited value for accomplishing complex structural alterations that may be required. Consequently, advanced theory-guided learning systems require flexible representation and flexible structure. An analysis of various theory revision systems and theory-guided learning systems reveals specific strengths and weaknesses in terms of these two desired properties. Designed to capture the underlying qualities of each system, a new system uses theory-guided constructive induction. Experiments in three domains show improvement over previous theory-guided systems. This leads to a study of the behavior, limitations, and potential of theory-guided constructive induction. ',\n",

       " ' Collaborating on Referring Expressions This paper presents a computational model of how conversational participants collaborate in order to make a referring action successful. The model is based on the view of language as goal-directed behavior. We propose that the content of a referring expression can be accounted for by the planning paradigm. Not only does this approach allow the processes of building referring expressions and identifying their referents to be captured by plan construction and plan inference, it also allows us to account for how participants clarify a referring expression by using meta-actions that reason about and manipulate the plan derivation that corresponds to the referring expression. To account for how clarification goals arise and how inferred clarification plans affect the agent, we propose that the agents are in a certain state of mind, and that this state includes an intention to achieve the goal of referring and a plan that the agents are currently considering. It is this mental state that sanctions the adoption of goals and the acceptance of inferred plans, and so acts as a link between understanding and generation. ',\n",

We apply a set of rules for the transfer of control to 4 sets of dialogues consisting of a total of 1862 turns. The application of the control rules lets us derive domain-independent discourse structures. The derived structures indicate that initiative plays a role in the structuring of discourse. In order to explore the relationship of control and initiative to discourse processes like centering, we analyze the distribution of four different classes of anaphora for two data sets. This distribution indicates that some control segments are hierarchically related to others. The analysis suggests that discourse participants often mutually agree to a change of topic. We also compared initiative in Task Oriented and Advice Giving dialogues and found that both allocation of control and the manner in which control is transferred is radically different for the two dialogue types. These differences can be explained in terms of collaborative planning principles. ',\n",

We describe a new heuristic technique, path optimization, and its application to two variations of graph partitioning: the max_cut problem and the min_quotient_cut problem. We present the results of computational comparisons between this technique and the Kernighan-Lin algorithm, the simulated annealing algorithm, the FLOW-lagorithm the multilevel algorithm, and teh recent 0.878-approximation algorithm. The experiments were conducted on two classes of graphs that have become standard for such tests: random and random geometric. They show that for both classes of inputs and both variations of the problem, the new heuristic is competitive with the other algorithms and holds an advantage for min_quotient_cut when applied to very large, sparse geometric graphs. In the last part of the paper, we describe an approach to analyzing graph partitioning algorithms from the statistical point of view. Every partitioning of a graph is viewed as a result achieved by a near gready partitioning algorithm. The experiments show that for good partitionings, the number of non-greedy steps needed to obtain them is quite small; moreover, it is statistically smaller for better partitionings. This led us to conjecture that there exists an optimal distribution of the non-greedy steps that characterize the classes of graphs that we studied. ',\n",

       " \" A Processing Model for Free Word Order Languages Like many verb-final languages, Germn displays considerable word-order freedom: there is no syntactic constraint on the ordering of the nominal arguments of a verb, as long as the verb remains in final position. This effect is referred to as ``scrambling'', and is interpreted in transformational frameworks as leftward movement of the arguments. Furthermore, arguments from an embedded clause may move out of their clause; this effect is referred to as ``long-distance scrambling''. While scrambling has recently received considerable attention in the syntactic literature, the status of long-distance scrambling has only rarely been addressed. The reason for this is the problematic status of the data: not only is long-distance scrambling highly dependent on pragmatic context, it also is strongly subject to degradation due to processing constraints. As in the case of center-embedding, it is not immediately clear whether to assume that observed unacceptability of highly complex sentences is due to grammatical restrictions, or whether we should assume that the competence grammar does not place any restrictions on scrambling (and that, therefore, all such sentences are in fact grammatical), and the unacceptability of some (or most) of the grammatically possible word orders is due to processing limitations. In this paper, we will argue for the second view by presenting a processing model for German. \",\n",
       " \" Linear Logic for Meaning Assembly Semantic theories of natural language associate meanings with utterances by providing meanings for lexical items and rules for determining the meaning of larger units given the meanings of their parts. Meanings are often assumed to combine via function application, which works well when constituent structure trees are used to guide semantic composition. However, we believe that the functional structure of Lexical-Functional Grammar is best used to provide the syntactic information necessary for constraining derivations of meaning in a cross-linguistically uniform format. It has been difficult, however, to reconcile this approach with the combination of meanings by function application. In contrast to compositional approaches, we present a deductive approach to assembling meanings, based on reasoning with constraints, which meshes well with the unordered nature of information in the functional structure. Our use of linear logic as a `glue' for assembling meanings allows for a coherent treatment of the LFG requirements of completeness and coherence as well as of modification and quantification. \",\n",

We argue that the best estimator is provided by computing the relative frequencies of the various functions among the hapax legomena --- the forms that occur exactly once in a corpus. This result has important implications for the development of stochastic morphological taggers, especially when some initial hand-tagging of a corpus is required: For predicting lexical priors for very low-frequency morphologically ambiguous types (most of which would not occur in any given corpus) one should concentrate on tagging a good representative sample of the hapax legomena, rather than extensively tagging words of all frequency ranges.

The design and implementation of SKOPE demonstrates how connectionist/symbolic hybrid architectures can be constructed for spoken agglutinative language processing.

We use a rich ontology and a set of methodological principles that embed the essence of Meinong's philosophy and Grice's conversational principles into a stratified logic, under an unrestricted interpretation of the quantifiers. The result is a logical formalism that yields a tractable computational method that uniformly calculates all the presuppositions of a given utterance, including the existential ones. \",\n",
       " \" A Uniform Treatment of Pragmatic Inferences in Simple and Complex Utterances and Sequences of Utterances Drawing appropriate defeasible inferences has been proven to be one of the most pervasive puzzles of natural language processing and a recurrent problem in pragmatics. This paper provides a theoretical framework, called ``stratified logic'', that can accommodate defeasible pragmatic inferences. The framework yields an algorithm that computes the conversational, conventional, scalar, clausal, and normal state implicatures; and the presuppositions that are associated with utterances.

       " \" A Formalism and an Algorithm for Computing Pragmatic Inferences and Detecting Infelicities Since Austin introduced the term ``infelicity'', the linguistic literature has been flooded with its use, but no formal or computational explanation has been given for it. This thesis provides one for those infelicities that occur when a pragmatic inference is cancelled. Our contribution assumes the existence of a finer grained taxonomy with respect to pragmatic inferences. It is shown that if one wants to account for the natural language expressiveness, one should distinguish between pragmatic inferences that are felicitous to defeat and pragmatic inferences that are infelicitously defeasible. Thus, it is shown that one should consider at least three types of information: indefeasible, felicitously defeasible, and infelicitously defeasible. The cancellation of the last of these determines the pragmatic infelicities. A new formalism has been devised to accommodate the three levels of information, called ``stratified logic''. Within it, we are able to express formally notions such as ``utterance U presupposes P'' or ``utterance U is infelicitous''. Special attention is paid to the implications that our work has in solving some well-known existential philosophical puzzles. The formalism yields an algorithm for computing interpretations for utterances, for determining their associated presuppositions, and for signalling infelicitous utterances that has been implemented in Common Lisp. The algorithm applies equally to simple and complex utterances and sequences of utterances. \",\n",

We review several possible computational interpretations of the conversational implicature maxims, with different computational costs, and argue that the simplest may be the best, because it seems to be closest to what human speakers do.

       " \" Quantifiers, Anaphora, and Intensionality The relationship between Lexical-Functional Grammar LFG {\\\\em functional structures} (f-structures) for sentences and their semantic interpretations can be expressed directly in a fragment of linear logic in a way that correctly explains the constrained interactions between quantifier scope ambiguity, bound anaphora and intensionality. This deductive approach to semantic interpretaion obviates the need for additional mechanisms, such as Cooper storage, to represent the possible scopes of a quantified NP, and explains the interactions between quantified NPs, anaphora and intensional verbs such as `seek'. A single specification in linear logic of the argument requirements of intensional verbs is sufficient to derive the correct reading predictions for intensional-verb clauses both with nonquantified and with quantified direct objects. In particular, both de dicto and de re readings are derived for quantified objects. The effects of type-raising or quantifying-in rules in other frameworks here just follow as linear-logic theorems. While our approach resembles current categorial approaches in important ways, it differs from them in allowing the greater type flexibility of categorial semantics while maintaining a precise connection to syntax. As a result, we are able to provide derivations for certain readings of sentences with intensional verbs and complex direct objects that are not derivable in current purely categorial accounts of the syntax-semantics interface. \",\n",

In this paper, I describe SPATTER, a statistical parser based on decision-tree learning techniques which constructs a complete parse for every sentence and achieves accuracy rates far better than any published result. This work is based on the following premises: (1) grammars are too complex and detailed to develop manually for most interesting domains; (2) parsing models must rely heavily on lexical and contextual information to analyze sentences accurately; and (3) existing {}-gram modeling techniques are inadequate for parsing models. In experiments comparing SPATTER with IBM's computer manuals parser, SPATTER significantly outperforms the grammar-based parser. Evaluating SPATTER against the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal corpus using the PARSEVAL measures, SPATTER achieves 86\\\\% precision, 86\\\\% recall, and 1.3 crossing brackets per sentence for sentences of 40 words or less, and 91\\\\% precision, 90\\\\% recall, and 0.5 crossing brackets for sentences between 10 and 20 words in length. \",\n",
       " ' The intersection of Finite State Automata and Definite Clause Grammars Bernard Lang defines parsing as the calculation of the intersection of a FSA (the input) and a CFG. Viewing the input for parsing as a FSA rather than as a string combines well with some approaches in speech understanding systems, in which parsing takes a word lattice as input (rather than a word string). Furthermore, certain techniques for robust parsing can be modelled as finite state transducers. In this paper we investigate how we can generalize this approach for unification grammars. In particular we will concentrate on how we might the calculation of the intersection of a FSA and a DCG. It is shown that existing parsing algorithms can be easily extended for FSA inputs. However, we also show that the termination properties change drastically: we show that it is undecidable whether the intersection of a FSA and a DCG is empty (even if the DCG is off-line parsable). Furthermore we discuss approaches to cope with the problem. ',\n",
       " ' Adaptive Load Balancing: A Study in Multi-Agent Learning We study the process of multi-agent reinforcement learning in the context of load balancing in a distributed system, without use of either central coordination or explicit communication. We first define a precise framework in which to study adaptive load balancing, important features of which are its stochastic nature and the purely local information available to individual agents. Given this framework, we show illuminating results on the interplay between basic adaptive behavior parameters and their effect on system efficiency. We then investigate the properties of adaptive load balancing in heterogeneous populations, and address the issue of exploration vs. exploitation in that context. Finally, we show that naive use of communication may not improve, and might even harm system efficiency. ',\n",

The algorithm employs a greedy heuristic search within a Bayesian framework, and a post-pass using the Inside-Outside algorithm. We compare the performance of our algorithm to n-gram models and the Inside-Outside algorithm in three language modeling tasks. In two of the tasks, the training data is generated by a probabilistic context-free grammar and in both tasks our algorithm outperforms the other techniques. The third task involves naturally-occurring data, and in this task our algorithm does not perform as well as n-gram models but vastly outperforms the Inside-Outside algorithm. ',\n",

In particular, we show that a single k-ary recursive constant-depth determinate clause is learnable. Two-clause programs consisting of one learnable recursive clause and one constant-depth determinate non-recursive clause are also learnable, if an additional ``basecase'' oracle is assumed. These results immediately imply the pac-learnability of these classes. Although these classes of learnable recursive programs are very constrained, it is shown in a companion paper that they are maximally general, in that generalizing either class in any natural way leads to a computationally difficult learning problem. Thus, taken together with its companion paper, this paper establishes a boundary of efficient learnability for recursive logic programs. \",\n",

In this paper we present negative results showing that any natural generalization of this class is hard to learn in Valiant's model of pac-learnability. In particular, we show that the following program classes are cryptographically hard to learn: programs with an unbounded number of constant-depth linear recursive clauses; programs with one constant-depth determinate clause containing an unbounded number of recursive calls; and programs with one linear recursive clause of constant locality. These results immediately imply the non-learnability of any more general class of programs. We also show that learning a constant-depth determinate program with either two linear recursive clauses or one linear recursive clause and one non-recursive clause is as hard as learning boolean DNF. Together with positive results from the companion paper, these negative results establish a boundary of efficient learnability for recursive function-free clauses. \",\n",
       " ' Provably Bounded-Optimal Agents Since its inception, artificial intelligence has relied upon a theoretical foundation centered around perfect rationality as the desired property of intelligent systems. We argue, as others have done, that this foundation is inadequate because it imposes fundamentally unsatisfiable requirements. As a result, there has arisen a wide gap between theory and practice in AI, hindering progress in the field. We propose instead a property called bounded optimality. Roughly speaking, an agent is bounded-optimal if its program is a solution to the constrained optimization problem presented by its architecture and the task environment. We show how to construct agents with this property for a simple class of machine architectures in a broad class of real-time environments. We illustrate these results using a simple model of an automated mail sorting facility. We also define a weaker property, asymptotic bounded optimality ABO, that generalizes the notion of optimality in classical complexity theory. We then construct universal ABO programs, i.e., programs that are ABO no matter what real-time constraints are applied. Universal ABO programs can be used as building blocks for more complex systems. We conclude with a discussion of the prospects for bounded optimality as a theoretical basis for AI, and relate it to similar trends in philosophy, economics, and game theory. ',\n",
       " ' Using Pivot Consistency to Decompose and Solve Functional CSPs Many studies have been carried out in order to increase the search efficiency of constraint satisfaction problems; among them, some make use of structural properties of the constraint network; others take into account semantic properties of the constraints, generally assuming that all the constraints possess the given property. In this paper, we propose a new decomposition method benefiting from both semantic properties of functional constraints (not bijective constraints) and structural properties of the network; furthermore, not all the constraints need to be functional. We show that under some conditions, the existence of solutions can be guaranteed. We first characterize a particular subset of the variables, which we name a root set. We then introduce pivot consistency, a new local consistency which is a weak form of path consistency and can be achieved in O(n^2d^2) complexity (instead of O(n^3d^3) for path consistency), and we present associated properties; in particular, we show that any consistent instantiation of the root set can be linearly extended to a solution, which leads to the presentation of the aforementioned new method for solving by decomposing functional CSPs.

       " ' New Techniques for Context Modeling We introduce three new techniques for statistical language models: extension modeling, nonmonotonic contexts, and the divergence heuristic. Together these techniques result in language models that have few states, even fewer parameters, and low message entropies. For example, our techniques achieve a message entropy of 1.97 bits/char on the Brown corpus using only 89,325 parameters. In contrast, the character 4-gram model requires more than 250 times as many parameters in order to achieve a message entropy of only 2.47 bits/char. The fact that our model performs significantly better while using vastly fewer parameters indicates that it is a better probability model of natural language text. ',\n",
       " ' Response Generation in Collaborative Negotiation In collaborative planning activities, since the agents are autonomous and heterogeneous, it is inevitable that conflicts arise in their beliefs during the planning process. In cases where such conflicts are relevant to the task at hand, the agents should engage in collaborative negotiation as an attempt to square away the discrepancies in their beliefs. This paper presents a computational strategy for detecting conflicts regarding proposed beliefs and for engaging in collaborative negotiation to resolve the conflicts that warrant resolution. Our model is capable of selecting the most effective aspect to address in its pursuit of conflict resolution in cases where multiple conflicts arise, and of selecting appropriate evidence to justify the need for such modification. Furthermore, by capturing the negotiation process in a recursive Propose-Evaluate-Modify cycle of actions, our model can successfully handle embedded negotiation subdialogues. ',\n",

       " ' A Symbolic and Surgical Acquisition of Terms through Variation Terminological acquisition is an important issue in learning for NLP due to the constant terminological renewal through technological changes. Terms play a key role in several NLP-activities such as machine translation, automatic indexing or text understanding. In opposition to classical once-and-for-all approaches, we propose an incremental process for terminological enrichment which operates on existing reference lists and large corpora. Candidate terms are acquired by extracting variants of reference terms through {\\\\em FASTR}, a unification-based partial parser. As acquisition is performed within specific morpho-syntactic contexts (coordinations, insertions or permutations of compounds), rich conceptual links are learned together with candidate terms. A clustering of terms related through coordination yields classes of conceptually close terms while graphs resulting from insertions denote generic/specific relations. A graceful degradation of the volume of acquisition on partial initial lists confirms the robustness of the method to incomplete data. ',\n",

This paper focuses on an evaluation mechanism that can be used to evaluate semantic clusters produced by a system against those provided by human experts. ',\n",
       " ' Learning Syntactic Rules and Tags with Genetic Algorithms for Information Retrieval and Filtering: An Empirical Basis for Grammatical Rules The grammars of natural languages may be learned by using genetic algorithms that reproduce and mutate grammatical rules and part-of-speech tags, improving the quality of later generations of grammatical components. Syntactic rules are randomly generated and then evolve; those rules resulting in improved parsing and occasionally improved retrieval and filtering performance are allowed to further propagate. The LUST system learns the characteristics of the language or sublanguage used in document abstracts by learning from the document rankings obtained from the parsed abstracts. Unlike the application of traditional linguistic rules to retrieval and filtering applications, LUST develops grammatical structures and tags without the prior imposition of some common grammatical assumptions (e.g., part-of-speech assumptions), producing grammars that are empirically based and are optimized for this particular application.

The addition of set types to the grammar and spatial indexing of the data make it possible to efficiently parse real diagrams of substantial complexity. The system is probably the first to demonstrate efficient diagram parsing using grammars that easily be retargeted to other domains. The work assumes that the diagrams are available as a flat collection of graphics primitives: lines, polygons, circles, Bezier curves and text. This is appropriate for future electronic documents or for vectorized diagrams converted from scanned images. The classes of diagrams that we have analyzed include x,y data graphs and genetic diagrams drawn from the biological literature, as well as finite state automata diagrams (states and arcs).

In this model ontology is embedded into the grammar; e.g. the hierarchy of {\\\\it np} constructions is based on the corresponding ontology. Ontology is also used in defining contextual parameters; e.g. . A parser based on this model allowed us to build a set of dialog understanding systems that include an on-line calendar, a banking machine, and an insurance quote system.

We show that construction-based representations are at least an order of magnitude more compact that the corresponding lexicalized representations of the same linguistic data. The result is significant for our understanding of the relationship between syntax and semantics, and consequently for choosing NLP architectures. For instance, whether the processing should proceed in a pipeline from syntax to semantics to pragmatics, and whether all linguistic information should be combined in a set of constraints. From a broader perspective, this paper does not only argue for a certain model of processing, but also provides a methodology for determining advantages of different approaches to NLP. ',\n",
       " \" Semantic Ambiguity and Perceived Ambiguity I explore some of the issues that arise when trying to establish a connection between the underspecification hypothesis pursued in the NLP literature and work on ambiguity in semantics and in the psychological literature. A theory of underspecification is developed `from the first principles', i.e., starting from a definition of what it means for a sentence to be semantically ambiguous and from what we know about the way humans deal with ambiguity. An underspecified language is specified as the translation language of a grammar covering sentences that display three classes of semantic ambiguity: lexical ambiguity, scopal ambiguity, and referential ambiguity. The expressions of this language denote sets of senses. A formalization of defeasible reasoning with underspecified representations is presented, based on Default Logic. Some issues to be confronted by such a formalization are discussed. \",\n",

However, this possibility is mostly limited and does not include nonmonotonic operations. In this paper we show how nonmonotonic operations can also be user-defined by applying default logic (Reiter 1980) and generalizing previous results on nonmonotonic sorts (Young & Rounds 1993).

This provides a flexible approach to establishing language-theoretic complexity results for formalisms that are based on systems of well-formedness constraints on trees. We demonstrate this technique by sketching two such results for Government and Binding Theory. First, we show that {\\\\em free-indexation\\\\/}, the mechanism assumed to mediate a variety of agreement and binding relationships in GB, is not definable in and therefore not enforcible by CFGs. Second, we show how, in spite of this limitation, a reasonably complete GB account of English can be defined in . Consequently, the language licensed by that account is strongly context-free. We illustrate some of the issues involved in establishing this result by looking at the definition, in , of chains. The limitations of this definition provide some insight into the types of natural linguistic principles that correspond to higher levels of language complexity. We close with some speculation on the possible significance of these results for generative linguistics. ',\n",
       " \" Text Chunking using Transformation-Based Learning Eric Brill introduced transformation-based learning and showed that it can do part-of-speech tagging with fairly high accuracy. The same method can be applied at a higher level of textual interpretation for locating chunks in the tagged text, including non-recursive ``baseNP'' chunks. For this purpose, it is convenient to view chunking as a tagging problem by encoding the chunk structure in new tags attached to each word. In automatic tests using Treebank-derived data, this technique achieved recall and precision rates of roughly 92% for baseNP chunks and 88% for somewhat more complex chunks that partition the sentence. Some interesting adaptations to the transformation-based learning approach are also suggested by this application. \",\n",
       " ' Ubiquitous Talker: Spoken Language Interaction with Real World Objects Augmented reality is a research area that tries to embody an electronic information space within the real world, through computational devices. A crucial issue within this area, is the recognition of real world objects or situations. In natural language processing, it is much easier to determine interpretations of utterances, even if they are ill-formed, when the context or situation is fixed. We therefore introduce robust, natural language processing into a system of augmented reality with situation awareness. Based on this idea, we have developed a portable system, called the Ubiquitous Talker. This consists of an LCD display that reflects the scene at which a user is looking as if it is a transparent glass, a CCD camera for recognizing real world objects with color-bar ID codes, a microphone for recognizing a human voice and a speaker which outputs a synthesized voice. The Ubiquitous Talker provides its user with some information related to a recognized object, by using the display and voice. It also accepts requests or questions as voice inputs. The user feels as if he/she is talking with the object itself through the system. ',\n",
       " ' Robust Parsing Based on Discourse Information: Completing partial parses of ill-formed sentences on the basis of discourse information In a consistent text, many words and phrases are repeatedly used in more than one sentence. When an identical phrase (a set of consecutive words) is repeated in different sentences, the constituent words of those sentences tend to be associated in identical modification patterns with identical parts of speech and identical modifiee-modifier relationships. Thus, when a syntactic parser cannot parse a sentence as a unified structure, parts of speech and modifiee-modifier relationships among morphologically identical words in complete parses of other sentences within the same text provide useful information for obtaining partial parses of the sentence. In this paper, we describe a method for completing partial parses by maintaining consistency among morphologically identical words within the same text as regards their part of speech and their modifiee-modifier relationship. The experimental results obtained by using this method with technical documents offer good prospects for improving the accuracy of sentence analysis in a broad-coverage natural language processing system such as a machine translation system.

       " ' Automatic Evaluation and Uniform Filter Cascades for Inducing N-Best Translation Lexicons This paper shows how to induce an N-best translation lexicon from a bilingual text corpus using statistical properties of the corpus together with four external knowledge sources. The knowledge sources are cast as filters, so that any subset of them can be cascaded in a uniform framework. A new objective evaluation measure is used to compare the quality of lexicons induced with different filter cascades. The best filter cascades improve lexicon quality by up to 137% over the plain vanilla statistical method, and approach human performance. Drastically reducing the size of the training corpus has a much smaller impact on lexicon quality when these knowledge sources are used. This makes it practical to train on small hand-built corpora for language pairs where large bilingual corpora are unavailable. Moreover, three of the four filters prove useful even when used with large training corpora. ',\n",

It describes an architecture suitable for rapid development of high-quality limited-domain translation systems, which has been implemented within an advanced prototype English to French spoken language translator. The focus of the paper is the hybrid transfer model which combines unification-based rules and a set of trainable statistical preferences; roughly, rules encode domain-independent grammatical information and preferences encode domain-dependent distributional information. The preferences are trained from sets of examples produced by the system, which have been annotated by human judges as correct or incorrect. An experiment is described in which the model was tested on a 2000 utterance sample of previously unseen data. ',\n",
       " ' TAKTAG: Two-phase learning method for hybrid statistical/rule-based part-of-speech disambiguation Both statistical and rule-based approaches to part-of-speech POS disambiguation have their own advantages and limitations. Especially for Korean, the narrow windows provided by hidden markov model HMM cannot cover the necessary lexical and long-distance dependencies for POS disambiguation. On the other hand, the rule-based approaches are not accurate and flexible to new tag-sets and languages. In this regard, the statistical/rule-based hybrid method that can take advantages of both approaches is called for the robust and flexible POS disambiguation. We present one of such method, that is, a two-phase learning architecture for the hybrid statistical/rule-based POS disambiguation, especially for Korean. In this method, the statistical learning of morphological tagging is error-corrected by the rule-based learning of Brill [1992] style tagger. We also design the hierarchical and flexible Korean tag-set to cope with the multiple tagging applications, each of which requires different tag-set. Our experiments show that the two-phase learning method can overcome the undesirable features of solely HMM-based or solely rule-based tagging, especially for morphologically complex Korean. ',\n",
       " ' FLECS: Planning with a Flexible Commitment Strategy There has been evidence that least-commitment planners can efficiently handle planning problems that involve difficult goal interactions. This evidence has led to the common belief that delayed-commitment is the best possible planning strategy. However, we recently found evidence that eager-commitment planners can handle a variety of planning problems more efficiently, in particular those with difficult operator choices. Resigned to the futility of trying to find a universally successful planning strategy, we devised a planner that can be used to study which domains and problems are best for which planning strategies. In this article we introduce this new planning algorithm, FLECS, which uses a FLExible Commitment Strategy with respect to plan-step orderings. It is able to use any strategy from delayed-commitment to eager-commitment. The combination of delayed and eager operator-ordering commitments allows FLECS to take advantage of the benefits of explicitly using a simulated execution state and reasoning about planning constraints. FLECS can vary its commitment strategy across different problems and domains, and also during the course of a single planning problem. FLECS represents a novel contribution to planning in that it explicitly provides the choice of which commitment strategy to use while planning. FLECS provides a framework to investigate the mapping from planning domains and problems to efficient planning strategies. ',\n",

It is particularly useful for problems that involve rules with specific exceptions, such as learning the past-tense of English verbs, a task widely studied in the context of the symbolic/connectionist debate. FOIDL is able to learn concise, accurate programs for this problem from significantly fewer examples than previous methods (both connectionist and symbolic). ',\n",

In order to account for the variety and to identify the parameters governing the choices, detailled linguistic analyses are necessary. We worked with one area of discourse relations, the Concession family, identified its underlying pragmatics and semantics, and undertook extensive corpus studies to examine the range of markers used in both English and German. On the basis of an initial classification of these markers, we propose a generation model for producing bilingual text that can incorporate marker choice into its overall decision framework. ',\n",

Since the publication of Nunberg's (1990) monograph on the topic, however, punctuation has seen its stock begin to rise: spurred in part by Nunberg's ground-breaking work, a number of valuable inquiries have been subsequently undertaken, including Hovy and Arens (1991), Dale (1991), Pascual (1993), Jones (1994), and Briscoe (1994). Continuing this line of research, I investigate in this paper how Nunberg's approach to presenting punctuation (and other formatting devices) might be incorporated into NLG systems.

These characteristic properties come from the real world domain (K-context), the type of events the texts describe (F-context) and the genre of the texts (E-context). Together, these three contexts provide elements for the resolution of anaphoric expressions and for several types of disambiguation.

       " ' Inducing Features of Random Fields We present a technique for constructing random fields from a set of training samples. The learning paradigm builds increasingly complex fields by allowing potential functions, or features, that are supported by increasingly large subgraphs. Each feature has a weight that is trained by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model and the empirical distribution of the training data. A greedy algorithm determines how features are incrementally added to the field and an iterative scaling algorithm is used to estimate the optimal values of the weights. The statistical modeling techniques introduced in this paper differ from those common to much of the natural language processing literature since there is no probabilistic finite state or push-down automaton on which the model is built. Our approach also differs from the techniques common to the computer vision literature in that the underlying random fields are non-Markovian and have a large number of parameters that must be estimated. Relations to other learning approaches including decision trees and Boltzmann machines are given. As a demonstration of the method, we describe its application to the problem of automatic word classification in natural language processing.

This distinction underlies my proposals about the attentional consequences of pitch accents when applied to pronominals, in particular, that while most pitch accents may weaken or reinforce a cospecifier's status as the center of attention, a contrastively stressed pronominal may force a shift, even when contraindicated by textual features. \",\n",

This approach uses bootstrapping techniques, specifically so that ambiguity in the dictionary text can be treated properly. This approach consists of processing an on-line dictionary multiple times, each time refining the lexical information previously acquired and identifying new lexical information. The strength of this approach is that lexical information can be acquired from definitions which are syntactically ambiguous, given that information acquired during the first pass can be used to improve the syntactic analysis of definitions in subsequent passes. In the context of a lexical knowledge base, the types of lexical information that need to be represented cannot be viewed as a fixed set, but rather as a set that will change given the resources of the lexical knowledge base and the requirements of analysis systems which access it.

The result of the analysis is then passed to a lexicalization module which chooses the right words of natural language to use, and builds a linguistic semantic network. This semantic network is then generated into French sentences via hierarchization into trees, using a lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar. Finally we describe the modular, customizable interface which has been developed for this system. \",\n",

       " ' Building and Refining Abstract Planning Cases by Change of Representation Language ion is one of the most promising approaches to improve the performance of problem solvers. In several domains abstraction by dropping sentences of a domain description -- as used in most hierarchical planners -- has proven useful. In this paper we present examples which illustrate significant drawbacks of abstraction by dropping sentences. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a more general view of abstraction involving the change of representation language. We have developed a new abstraction methodology and a related sound and complete learning algorithm that allows the complete change of representation language of planning cases from concrete to abstract. However, to achieve a powerful change of the representation language, the abstract language itself as well as rules which describe admissible ways of abstracting states must be provided in the domain model. This new abstraction approach is the core of Paris (Plan Abstraction and Refinement in an Integrated System), a system in which abstract planning cases are automatically learned from given concrete cases. An empirical study in the domain of process planning in mechanical engineering shows significant advantages of the proposed reasoning from abstract cases over classical hierarchical planning. ',\n",

The paper analyses the necessary preconditions for achieving a higher degree of robustness in natural language processing and suggests a quite different approach based on a procedure for structural disambiguation.

This model is based on feature unification and it relies upon a lexicon of allomorphs both for stems and morphemes. Word forms are built by the concatenation of allomorphs by means of special contextual features. We make use of standard Definite Clause Grammars DCG included in most Prolog implementations, instead of the typical finite-state approach. This allows us to take advantage of the declarativity and bidirectionality of Logic Programming for NLP. The most salient feature of this approach is simplicity: A really straightforward rule and lexical components. We have developed a very simple model for complex phenomena. Declarativity, bidirectionality, consistency and completeness of the model are discussed: all and only correct word forms are analysed or generated, even alternative ones and gaps in paradigms are preserved. A Prolog implementation has been developed for both analysis and generation of Spanish word forms. It consists of only six DCG rules, because our {\\\\em lexicalist\\\\/} approach --i.e. most information is in the dictionary.

       " ' Transfer in a Connectionist Model of the Acquisition of Morphology The morphological systems of natural languages are replete with examples of the same devices used for multiple purposes: (1) the same type of morphological process (for example, suffixation for both noun case and verb tense) and (2) identical morphemes (for example, the same suffix for English noun plural and possessive). These sorts of similarity would be expected to convey advantages on language learners in the form of transfer from one morphological category to another. Connectionist models of morphology acquisition have been faulted for their supposed inability to represent phonological similarity across morphological categories and hence to facilitate transfer. This paper describes a connectionist model of the acquisition of morphology which is shown to exhibit transfer of this type. The model treats the morphology acquisition problem as one of learning to map forms onto meanings and vice versa. As the network learns these mappings, it makes phonological generalizations which are embedded in connection weights. Since these weights are shared by different morphological categories, transfer is enabled. In a set of experiments with artificial stimuli, networks were trained first on one morphological task (e.g., tense) and then on a second (e.g., number). It is shown that in the context of suffixation, prefixation, and template rules, the second task is facilitated when the second category either makes use of the same forms or the same general process type (e.g., prefixation) as the first.

       " ' A Constraint-based Case Frame Lexicon Architecture In Turkish, (and possibly in many other languages) verbs often convey several meanings (some totally unrelated) when they are used with subjects, objects, oblique objects, adverbial adjuncts, with certain lexical, morphological, and semantic features, and co-occurrence restrictions. In addition to the usual sense variations due to selectional restrictions on verbal arguments, in most cases, the meaning conveyed by a case frame is idiomatic and not compositional, with subtle constraints. In this paper, we present an approach to building a constraint-based case frame lexicon for use in natural language processing in Turkish, whose prototype we have implemented under the TFS system developed at Univ. of Stuttgart. A number of observations that we have made on Turkish have indicated that we need something beyond the traditional transitive and intransitive distinction, and utilize a framework where verb valence is considered as the obligatory co-existence of an arbitrary subset of possible arguments along with the obligatory exclusion of certain others, relative to a verb sense. Additional morphological lexical and semantic constraints on the syntactic constituents organized as a 5-tier constraint hierarchy, are utilized to map a given syntactic structure case-fraame to a specific verb sense.

LR-compiling techniques are used to allow a recursive-descent generation algorithm to perform functor merging much in the same way as an LR parser performs prefix merging. This is an improvement on the semantic-head-driven generator that results in a much smaller search space. The amount of semantic lookahead can be varied, and appropriate tradeoff points between table size and resulting nondeterminism can be found automatically. ',\n",
       " ' Error-tolerant Finite State Recognition with Applications to Morphological Analysis and Spelling Correction Error-tolerant recognition enables the recognition of strings that deviate mildly from any string in the regular set recognized by the underlying finite state recognizer. Such recognition has applications in error-tolerant morphological processing, spelling correction, and approximate string matching in information retrieval. After a description of the concepts and algorithms involved, we give examples from two applications: In the context of morphological analysis, error-tolerant recognition allows misspelled input word forms to be corrected, and morphologically analyzed concurrently. We present an application of this to error-tolerant analysis of agglutinative morphology of Turkish words. The algorithm can be applied to morphological analysis of any language whose morphology is fully captured by a single (and possibly very large) finite state transducer, regardless of the word formation processes and morphographemic phenomena involved. In the context of spelling correction, error-tolerant recognition can be used to enumerate correct candidate forms from a given misspelled string within a certain edit distance. Again, it can be applied to any language with a word list comprising all inflected forms, or whose morphology is fully described by a finite state transducer. We present experimental results for spelling correction for a number of languages. These results indicate that such recognition works very efficiently for candidate generation in spelling correction for many European languages such as English, Dutch, French, German, Italian (and others) with very large word lists of root and inflected forms (some containing well over 200,000 forms), generating all candidate solutions within 10 to 45 milliseconds (with edit distance 1) on a SparcStation 10/41.

       " ' Specifying Logic Programs in Controlled Natural Language Writing specifications for computer programs is not easy since one has to take into account the disparate conceptual worlds of the application domain and of software development. To bridge this conceptual gap we propose controlled natural language as a declarative and application-specific specification language. Controlled natural language is a subset of natural language that can be accurately and efficiently processed by a computer, but is expressive enough to allow natural usage by non-specialists. Specifications in controlled natural language are automatically translated into Prolog clauses, hence become formal and executable. The translation uses a definite clause grammar DCG enhanced by feature structures. Inter-text references of the specification, e.g. anaphora, are resolved with the help of discourse representation theory DRT. The generated Prolog clauses are added to a knowledge base. We have implemented a prototypical specification system that successfully processes the specification of a simple automated teller machine. ',\n",

       " \" On-line Learning of Binary Lexical Relations Using Two-dimensional Weighted Majority Algorithms We consider the problem of learning a certain type of lexical semantic knowledge that can be expressed as a binary relation between words, such as the so-called sub-categorization of verbs (a verb-noun relation) and the compound noun phrase relation (a noun-noun relation). Specifically, we view this problem as an on-line learning problem in the sense of Littlestone's learning model in which the learner's goal is to minimize the total number of prediction mistakes. In the computational learning theory literature, Goldman, Rivest and Schapire and subsequently Goldman and Warmuth have considered the on-line learning problem for binary relations R : X * Y -> {0, 1} in which one of the domain sets X can be partitioned into a relatively small number of types, namely clusters consisting of behaviorally indistinguishable members of X. In this paper, we extend this model and suppose that both of the sets X, Y can be partitioned into a small number of types, and propose a host of prediction algorithms which are two-dimensional extensions of Goldman and Warmuth's weighted majority type algorithm proposed for the original model. We apply these algorithms to the learning problem for the `compound noun phrase' relation, in which a noun is related to another just in case they can form a noun phrase together. Our experimental results show that all of our algorithms out-perform Goldman and Warmuth's algorithm. We also theoretically analyze the performance of one of our algorithms, in the form of an upper bound on the worst case number of prediction mistakes it makes. \",\n",

       " ' Using Qualitative Hypotheses to Identify Inaccurate Data Identifying inaccurate data has long been regarded as a significant and difficult problem in AI. In this paper, we present a new method for identifying inaccurate data on the basis of qualitative correlations among related data. First, we introduce the definitions of related data and qualitative correlations among related data. Then we put forward a new concept called support coefficient function SCF. SCF can be used to extract, represent, and calculate qualitative correlations among related data within a dataset. We propose an approach to determining dynamic shift intervals of inaccurate data, and an approach to calculating possibility of identifying inaccurate data, respectively. Both of the approaches are based on SCF. Finally we present an algorithm for identifying inaccurate data by using qualitative correlations among related data as confirmatory or disconfirmatory evidence. We have developed a practical system for interpreting infrared spectra by applying the method, and have fully tested the system against several hundred real spectra. The experimental results show that the method is significantly better than the conventional methods used in many similar systems. ',\n",
       " ' A Robust Parsing Algorithm For Link Grammars In this paper we present a robust parsing algorithm based on the link grammar formalism for parsing natural languages. Our algorithm is a natural extension of the original dynamic programming recognition algorithm which recursively counts the number of linkages between two words in the input sentence. The modified algorithm uses the notion of a null link in order to allow a connection between any pair of adjacent words, regardless of their dictionary definitions. The algorithm proceeds by making three dynamic programming passes. In the first pass, the input is parsed using the original algorithm which enforces the constraints on links to ensure grammaticality. In the second pass, the total cost of each substring of words is computed, where cost is determined by the number of null links necessary to parse the substring. The final pass counts the total number of parses with minimal cost. All of the original pruning techniques have natural counterparts in the robust algorithm. When used together with memoization, these techniques enable the algorithm to run efficiently with cubic worst-case complexity. We have implemented these ideas and tested them by parsing the Switchboard corpus of conversational English. This corpus is comprised of approximately three million words of text, corresponding to more than 150 hours of transcribed speech collected from telephone conversations restricted to 70 different topics. Although only a small fraction of the sentences in this corpus are grammatical by standard criteria, the robust link grammar parser is able to extract relevant structure for a large portion of the sentences. We present the results of our experiments using this system, including the analyses of selected and random sentences from the corpus. ',\n",

We have written a program for general link parsing and written a link grammar for the English language. The performance of this preliminary system -- both in the breadth of English phenomena that it captures and in the computational resources used -- indicates that the approach may have practical uses as well as linguistic significance. Our program is written in C and may be obtained through the internet. ',\n",

       " \" Generating efficient belief models for task-oriented dialogues We have shown that belief modelling for dialogue can be simplified if the assumption is made that the participants are cooperating, i.e., they are not committed to any goals requiring deception. In such domains, there is no need to maintain individual representations of deeply nested beliefs; instead, three specific types of belief can be used to summarize all the states of nested belief that can exist about a domain entity. Here, we set out to design a ``compiler'' for belief models. This system will accept as input a description of agents' interactions with a task domain expressed in a fully-expressive belief logic with non-monotonic and temporal extensions. It generates an operational belief model for use in that domain, sufficient for the requirements of cooperative dialogue, including the negotiation of complex domain plans. The compiled model incorporates the belief simplification mentioned above, and also uses a simplified temporal logic of belief based on the restricted circumstances under which beliefs can change. We shall review the motivation for creating such a system, and introduce a general procedure for taking a logical specification for a domain and procesing it into an operational model. We shall then discuss the specific changes that are made during this procedure for limiting the level of abstraction at which the concepts of belief nesting, default reasoning and time are expressed. Finally we shall go through a worked example relating to the Map Task, a simple cooperative problem-solving exercise. \",\n",

Multi-Lexeme translations are handled through bi-lexical rules which map bilingual lexical signs into new bilingual lexical signs. It is argued that much translation can be handled by equating translationally equivalent lists of lexical signs, either directly in the bilingual lexicon, or by deriving them through bi-lexical rules. Lexical semantic information organized as Qualia structures (Pustejovsky 1991) is used as a mechanism for restricting the domain of the rules. \",\n",
       " \" A Dynamic Approach to Rhythm in Language: Toward a Temporal Phonology It is proposed that the theory of dynamical systems offers appropriate tools to model many phonological aspects of both speech production and perception. A dynamic account of speech rhythm is shown to be useful for description of both Japanese mora timing and English timing in a phrase repetition task. This orientation contrasts fundamentally with the more familiar symbolic approach to phonology, in which time is modeled only with sequentially arrayed symbols. It is proposed that an adaptive oscillator offers a useful model for perceptual entrainment (or `locking in') to the temporal patterns of speech production. This helps to explain why speech is often perceived to be more regular than experimental measurements seem to justify. Because dynamic models deal with real time, they also help us understand how languages can differ in their temporal detail---contributing to foreign accents, for example. The fact that languages differ greatly in their temporal detail suggests that these effects are not mere motor universals, but that dynamical models are intrinsic components of the phonological characterization of language. \",\n",

In this paper, we discuss a three-stage approach to disambiguation in the context of a lexicalized grammar, using a variety of domain independent heuristic techniques. We present a training algorithm which uses hand-bracketed treebank parses to set the weights of these heuristics. We compare the performance of our grammar against the performance of the IBM statistical grammar, using both untrained and trained weights for the heuristics. ',\n",

In many situations, however, one would like to have uniform access to the linguistic information encoded in corpus annotations without having to know the classification schemes in detail. This paper describes a tool which maps unstructured morphosyntactic tags to a constraint-based, typed, configurable specification language, a ``standard tagset''. The mapping relies on a manually written set of mapping rules, which is automatically checked for consistency. In certain cases, unsharp mappings are unavoidable, and noise, i.e. groups of word forms {\\\\sl not} conforming to the specification, will appear in the output of the mapping. The system automatically detects such noise and informs the user about it.

First, I briefly review earlier results and show how these can be combined to bound the expected accuracy of a mode-based learner as a function of the volume of training data. I then develop a more accurate estimate of the expected accuracy function under the assumption that inputs are uniformly distributed. Since this estimate is expensive to compute, I also give a close but cheaply computable approximation to it. Finally, I report on a series of simulations exploring the effects of inputs that are not uniformly distributed.

This phenomenon hurts the forward propagation of long-term context information, as well as learning a hidden state representation to represent long-term context, which depends on propagating credit information backwards in time. Using results from Markov chain theory, we show that this problem of diffusion of context and credit is reduced when the transition probabilities approach 0 or 1, i.e., the transition probability matrices are sparse and the model essentially deterministic.

       " \" Improving Connectionist Energy Minimization Symmetric networks designed for energy minimization such as Boltzman machines and Hopfield nets are frequently investigated for use in optimization, constraint satisfaction and approximation of NP-hard problems. Nevertheless, finding a global solution (i.e., a global minimum for the energy function) is not guaranteed and even a local solution may take an exponential number of steps. We propose an improvement to the standard local activation function used for such networks. The improved algorithm guarantees that a global minimum is found in linear time for tree-like subnetworks. The algorithm, called activate, is uniform and does not assume that the network is tree-like. It can identify tree-like subnetworks even in cyclic topologies (arbitrary networks) and avoid local minima along these trees. For acyclic networks, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a global minimum from any initial state of the system (self-stabilization) and remains correct under various types of schedulers. On the negative side, we show that in the presence of cycles, no uniform algorithm exists that guarantees optimality even under a sequential asynchronous scheduler. An asynchronous scheduler can activate only one unit at a time while a synchronous scheduler can activate any number of units in a single time step. In addition, no uniform algorithm exists to optimize even acyclic networks when the scheduler is synchronous. Finally, we show how the algorithm can be improved using the cycle-cutset scheme. The general algorithm, called activate-with-cutset, improves over activate and has some performance guarantees that are related to the size of the network's cycle-cutset. \",\n",

Such systems naturally associate a ``measure of goodness'' or ``membership value'' with a recognized object. This measure of goodness is the result of combining individual measures, or membership values, from potentially many primitive evaluations of different properties of the object's shape. A membership function is used to compute the membership value when evaluating a primitive of a particular physical property of an object. In previous versions of a recognition system known as Gruff, the membership function for each of the primitive evaluations was hand-crafted by the system designer. In this paper, we provide a learning component for the Gruff system, called Omlet, that automatically learns membership functions given a set of example objects labeled with their desired category measure. The learning algorithm is generally applicable to any problem in which low-level membership values are combined through an and-or tree structure to give a final overall membership value. \",\n",

Bilingual nominal entries are disambiguated agains WordNet, therefore linking the bilingual dictionaries to WordNet yielding a multilingual LKB MLKB. The resulting MLKB has the same structure as WordNet, but some nodes are attached additionally to disambiguated vocabulary of other languages. Two different, complementary approaches are explored. In one of the approaches each entry of the dictionary is taken in turn, exploiting the information in the entry itself. The inferential capability for disambiguating the translation is given by Semantic Density over WordNet. In the other approach, the bilingual dictionary was merged with WordNet, exploiting mainly synonymy relations. Each of the approaches was used in a different dictionary. Both approaches attain high levels of precision on their own, showing that disambiguating bilingual nominal entries, and therefore linking bilingual dictionaries to WordNet is a feasible task. ',\n",

This paper stresses the need for discourse analysis the aim of which is to preserve the communicative meaning in English--Polish machine translation. Unlike English, which is a positional language with word order grammatically determined, Polish displays a strong tendency to order constituents according to their degree of salience, so that the most informationally salient elements are placed towards the end of the clause regardless of their grammatical function. The Centering Theory developed for tracking down given information units in English and the Theory of Functional Sentence Perspective predicting informativeness of subsequent constituents provide theoretical background for this work. The notion of {\\\\em center} is extended to accommodate not only for pronominalisation and exact reiteration but also for definiteness and other center pointing constructs.

Verbs such as make and take , when they function as support verbs, are often considered to be semantically light. To test our definition, we carried out an experiment based on that of Grefenstette and Teufel (1995), where we automatically identify light instances of these words in a corpus; this was done by incorporating our frequency-related definition of semantic weight into a statistical approach similar to that of Grefenstette and Teufel. The results show that this is a plausible definition of semantic lightness for verbs, which can possibly be extended to defining semantic lightness for other classes of words. ',\n",
       " ' Flexibly Instructable Agents This paper presents an approach to learning from situated, interactive tutorial instruction within an ongoing agent. Tutorial instruction is a flexible (and thus powerful) paradigm for teaching tasks because it allows an instructor to communicate whatever types of knowledge an agent might need in whatever situations might arise. To support this flexibility, however, the agent must be able to learn multiple kinds of knowledge from a broad range of instructional interactions. Our approach, called situated explanation, achieves such learning through a combination of analytic and inductive techniques. It combines a form of explanation-based learning that is situated for each instruction with a full suite of contextually guided responses to incomplete explanations. The approach is implemented in an agent called Instructo-Soar that learns hierarchies of new tasks and other domain knowledge from interactive natural language instructions. Instructo-Soar meets three key requirements of flexible instructability that distinguish it from previous systems: (1) it can take known or unknown commands at any instruction point; (2) it can handle instructions that apply to either its current situation or to a hypothetical situation specified in language (as in, for instance, conditional instructions); and (3) it can learn, from instructions, each class of knowledge it uses to perform tasks.

       " ' Toward an MT System without Pre-Editing --- Effects of New Methods in ALT-J/E --- Recently, several types of Japanese-to-English machine translation systems have been developed, but all of them require an initial process of rewriting the original text into easily translatable Japanese. Therefore these systems are unsuitable for translating information that needs to be speedily disseminated. To overcome this limitation, a Multi-Level Translation Method based on the Constructive Process Theory has been proposed. This paper describes the benefits of using this method in the Japanese-to-English machine translation system ALT-J/E. In comparison with conventional compositional methods, the Multi-Level Translation Method emphasizes the importance of the meaning contained in expression structures as a whole. It is shown to be capable of translating typical written Japanese based on the meaning of the text in its context, with comparative ease. We are now hopeful of carrying out useful machine translation with no manual pre-editing. ',\n",

       " \" The Effect of Resource Limits and Task Complexity on Collaborative Planning in Dialogue This paper shows how agents' choice in communicative action can be designed to mitigate the effect of their resource limits in the context of particular features of a collaborative planning task. I first motivate a number of hypotheses about effective language behavior based on a statistical analysis of a corpus of natural collaborative planning dialogues. These hypotheses are then tested in a dialogue testbed whose design is motivated by the corpus analysis. Experiments in the testbed examine the interaction between (1) agents' resource limits in attentional capacity and inferential capacity; (2) agents' choice in communication; and (3) features of communicative tasks that affect task difficulty such as inferential complexity, degree of belief coordination required, and tolerance for errors. The results show that good algorithms for communication must be defined relative to the agents' resource limits and the features of the task. Algorithms that are inefficient for inferentially simple, low coordination or fault-tolerant tasks are effective when tasks require coordination or complex inferences, or are fault-intolerant. The results provide an explanation for the occurrence of utterances in human dialogues that, prima facie, appear inefficient, and provide the basis for the design of effective algorithms for communicative choice for resource limited agents. \",\n",

Our constraint system extends rational unification by constraints x y saying that `` has at least the structure of '', modelled by a weak instance relation between trees. This notion of instance has been carefully chosen to be weaker than the usual one which renders semi-unification undecidable. Semi-unification has more than once served to link unification problems arising from type inference and those considered in computational linguistics. Just as polymorphic recursion corresponds to subsumption through the semi-unification problem, our type constraint problem corresponds to weak subsumption of feature graphs in linguistics.

       " ' Chart-driven Connectionist Categorial Parsing of Spoken Korean While most of the speech and natural language systems which were developed for English and other Indo-European languages neglect the morphological processing and integrate speech and natural language at the word level, for the agglutinative languages such as Korean and Japanese, the morphological processing plays a major role in the language processing since these languages have very complex morphological phenomena and relatively simple syntactic functionality. Obviously degenerated morphological processing limits the usable vocabulary size for the system and word-level dictionary results in exponential explosion in the number of dictionary entries. For the agglutinative languages, we need sub-word level integration which leaves rooms for general morphological processing. In this paper, we developed a phoneme-level integration model of speech and linguistic processings through general morphological analysis for agglutinative languages and a efficient parsing scheme for that integration. Korean is modeled lexically based on the categorial grammar formalism with unordered argument and suppressed category extensions, and chart-driven connectionist parsing method is introduced. ',\n",
       " ' Disambiguating Noun Groupings with Respect to WordNet Senses Word groupings useful for language processing tasks are increasingly available, as thesauri appear on-line, and as distributional word clustering techniques improve. However, for many tasks, one is interested in relationships among word {\\\\em senses}, not words. This paper presents a method for automatic sense disambiguation of nouns appearing within sets of related nouns --- the kind of data one finds in on-line thesauri, or as the output of distributional clustering algorithms. Disambiguation is performed with respect to WordNet senses, which are fairly fine-grained; however, the method also permits the assignment of higher-level WordNet categories rather than sense labels. The method is illustrated primarily by example, though results of a more rigorous evaluation are also presented. ',\n",

Our definition departs from the traditional view of causation in that causal assertions may vary with the set of decisions available. We argue that this approach provides added clarity to the notion of cause. Also in this paper, we examine the encoding of causal relationships in directed acyclic graphs. We describe a special class of influence diagrams, those in canonical form, and show its relationship to Pearl's representation of cause and effect. Finally, we show how canonical form facilitates counterfactual reasoning. \",\n",
       " ' Generalization of Clauses under Implication In the area of inductive learning, generalization is a main operation, and the usual definition of induction is based on logical implication. Recently there has been a rising interest in clausal representation of knowledge in machine learning. Almost all inductive learning systems that perform generalization of clauses use the relation theta-subsumption instead of implication. The main reason is that there is a well-known and simple technique to compute least general generalizations under theta-subsumption, but not under implication. However generalization under theta-subsumption is inappropriate for learning recursive clauses, which is a crucial problem since recursion is the basic program structure of logic programs. We note that implication between clauses is undecidable, and we therefore introduce a stronger form of implication, called T-implication, which is decidable between clauses. We show that for every finite set of clauses there exists a least general generalization under T-implication. We describe a technique to reduce generalizations under implication of a clause to generalizations under theta-subsumption of what we call an expansion of the original clause. Moreover we show that for every non-tautological clause there exists a T-complete expansion, which means that every generalization under T-implication of the clause is reduced to a generalization under theta-subsumption of the expansion.

Thereafter, the playing strengths are compared by means of tournaments between the resulting versions of a world-class Othello program. In this application, logistic regression - which is used here for the first time in the context of game playing - leads to better results than the other approaches. \",\n",
       " ' Translating between Horn Representations and their Characteristic Models Characteristic models are an alternative, model based, representation for Horn expressions. It has been shown that these two representations are incomparable and each has its advantages over the other. It is therefore natural to ask what is the cost of translating, back and forth, between these representations. Interestingly, the same translation questions arise in database theory, where it has applications to the design of relational databases. This paper studies the computational complexity of these problems. Our main result is that the two translation problems are equivalent under polynomial reductions, and that they are equivalent to the corresponding decision problem. Namely, translating is equivalent to deciding whether a given set of models is the set of characteristic models for a given Horn expression. We also relate these problems to the hypergraph transversal problem, a well known problem which is related to other applications in AI and for which no polynomial time algorithm is known. It is shown that in general our translation problems are at least as hard as the hypergraph transversal problem, and in a special case they are equivalent to it. ',\n",

The hardware platform, a special-purpose massively parallel system, has been chosen to minimize system production and operational costs. This paper presents a novel approach to expectation-driven low-level image segmentation, which can be mapped naturally onto mesh-connected massively parallel SIMD architectures capable of handling hierarchical data structures. The input image is assumed to contain a distorted version of a given template; a multiresolution stretching process is used to reshape the original template in accordance with the acquired image content, minimizing a potential function. The distorted template is the process output. ',\n",

The forward mapping from symbol sequences to the speech stream is modeled using features based on articulatory gestures.

The type feature structures to be encoded are constrained by appropriateness conditions as in Carpenter's ALE system. But unlike ALE, we impose a further independently motivated closed-world assumption. This assumption allows us to apply term encoding in cases that were problematic for previous approaches. In particular, previous approaches have ruled out multiple inheritance and further specification of feature-value declarations on subtypes. In the present approach, these spececial cases can be handled as well, though with some increase in complexity. For grammars without multiple inheritance and specification of feature values, the encoding presented here reduces to that of previous approaches. \",\n",
       " \" The Design and Experimental Analysis of Algorithms for Temporal Reasoning Many applications -- from planning and scheduling to problems in molecular biology -- rely heavily on a temporal reasoning component. In this paper, we discuss the design and empirical analysis of algorithms for a temporal reasoning system based on Allen's influential interval-based framework for representing temporal information. At the core of the system are algorithms for determining whether the temporal information is consistent, and, if so, finding one or more scenarios that are consistent with the temporal information. Two important algorithms for these tasks are a path consistency algorithm and a backtracking algorithm. For the path consistency algorithm, we develop techniques that can result in up to a ten-fold speedup over an already highly optimized implementation. For the backtracking algorithm, we develop variable and value ordering heuristics that are shown empirically to dramatically improve the performance of the algorithm. As well, we show that a previously suggested reformulation of the backtracking search problem can reduce the time and space requirements of the backtracking search. Taken together, the techniques we develop allow a temporal reasoning component to solve problems that are of practical size. \",\n",

The method uses information about the use of possessive pronouns in English treated as a lexical property of nouns, in addition to contextual information about noun phrase referentiality and the subject and main verb of the sentence that the noun phrase appears in. The proposed method has been implemented in NTT Communication Science Laboratories' Japanese-to-English machine translation system ALT-J/E.

Our goal in this paper is to take a first step toward dynamic reasoning in probabilistic databases with comparable efficiency. We propose a dynamic data structure that supports efficient algorithms for updating and querying singly connected Bayesian networks. In the conventional algorithm, new evidence is absorbed in O(1) time and queries are processed in time O(N), where N is the size of the network. We propose an algorithm which, after a preprocessing phase, allows us to answer queries in time O(log N) at the expense of O(log N) time per evidence absorption. The usefulness of sub-linear processing time manifests itself in applications requiring (near) real-time response over large probabilistic databases.

The characteristics of windows are studied by examining their within window density WWD and the S concentration SC, the concentration of terms from various document fields (e.g. title, abstract) in the fulltext. The rate of window occurrences from the beginning to the end of document fulltext differs between academic fields.

To reconcile those two alternatives, we designed an algorithm to compute finite-state approximations of context-free grammars and context-free-equivalent augmented phrase-structure grammars.

In order to assist with the efficiency, our method makes use of an existing thesaurus and restricts its attention on those partitions that are present as `cuts' in the thesaurus tree, thus reducing the generalization problem to that of estimating the `tree cut models' of the thesaurus. We then give an efficient algorithm which provably obtains the optimal tree cut model for the given frequency data, in the sense of MDL. We have used the case-frame patterns obtained using our method to resolve pp-attachment ambiguity.Our experimental results indicate that our method improves upon or is at least as effective as existing methods. \",\n",
       " ' Extraction of V-N-Collocations from Text Corpora: A Feasibility Study for German The usefulness of a statistical approach suggested by Church et al. (1991) is evaluated for the extraction of verb-noun (V-N) collocations from German text corpora. Some problematic issues of that method arising from properties of the German language are discussed and various modifications of the method are considered that might improve extraction results for German. The precision and recall of all variant methods is evaluated for V-N collocations containing support verbs, and the consequences for further work on the extraction of collocations from German corpora are discussed. With a sufficiently large corpus (>= 6 mio. word-tokens), the average error rate of wrong extractions can be reduced to 2.2% (97.8% precision) with the most restrictive method, however with a loss in data of almost 50% compared to a less restrictive method with still 87.6% precision. Depending on the goal to be achieved, emphasis can be put on a high recall for lexicographic purposes or on high precision for automatic lexical acquisition, in each case unfortunately leading to a decrease of the corresponding other variable. Low recall can still be acceptable if very large corpora (i.e. 50 - 100 million words) are available or if corpora for special domains are used in addition to the data found in machine readable (collocation) dictionaries.

       " ' Integrated speech and morphological processing in a connectionist continuous speech understanding for Korean A new tightly coupled speech and natural language integration model is presented for a TDNN-based continuous possibly large vocabulary speech recognition system for Korean. Unlike popular n-best techniques developed for integrating mainly HMM-based speech recognition and natural language processing in a {\\\\em word level}, which is obviously inadequate for morphologically complex agglutinative languages, our model constructs a spoken language system based on a {\\\\em morpheme-level} speech and language integration. With this integration scheme, the spoken Korean processing engine SKOPE is designed and implemented using a TDNN-based diphone recognition module integrated with a Viterbi-based lexical decoding and symbolic phonological/morphological co-analysis. Our experiment results show that the speaker-dependent continuous {\\\\em eojeol} (Korean word) recognition and integrated morphological analysis can be achieved with over 80.6% success rate directly from speech inputs for the middle-level vocabularies.

This paper describes a simple critic, a computer program which monitors the construction of inductive proofs attempting to identify diverging proof attempts. Divergence is recognized by means of a ``difference matching'' procedure. The critic then proposes lemmas and generalizations which ``ripple'' these differences away so that the proof can go through without divergence. The critic enables the theorem prover Spike to prove many theorems completely automatically from the definitions alone. \",\n",
       " \" Iterative Optimization and Simplification of Hierarchical Clusterings Clustering is often used for discovering structure in data. Clustering systems differ in the objective function used to evaluate clustering quality and the control strategy used to search the space of clusterings. Ideally, the search strategy should consistently construct clusterings of high quality, but be computationally inexpensive as well. In general, we cannot have it both ways, but we can partition the search so that a system inexpensively constructs a `tentative' clustering for initial examination, followed by iterative optimization, which continues to search in background for improved clusterings. Given this motivation, we evaluate an inexpensive strategy for creating initial clusterings, coupled with several control strategies for iterative optimization, each of which repeatedly modifies an initial clustering in search of a better one. One of these methods appears novel as an iterative optimization strategy in clustering contexts. Once a clustering has been constructed it is judged by analysts -- often according to task-specific criteria. Several authors have abstracted these criteria and posited a generic performance task akin to pattern completion, where the error rate over completed patterns is used to `externally' judge clustering utility. Given this performance task, we adapt resampling-based pruning strategies used by supervised learning systems to the task of simplifying hierarchical clusterings, thus promising to ease post-clustering analysis. Finally, we propose a number of objective functions, based on attribute-selection measures for decision-tree induction, that might perform well on the error rate and simplicity dimensions. \",\n",
       " \" Practical Methods for Proving Termination of General Logic Programs Termination of logic programs with negated body atoms (here called general logic programs) is an important topic. One reason is that many computational mechanisms used to process negated atoms, like Clark's negation as failure and Chan's constructive negation, are based on termination conditions. This paper introduces a methodology for proving termination of general logic programs w.r.t. the Prolog selection rule. The idea is to distinguish parts of the program depending on whether or not their termination depends on the selection rule. To this end, the notions of low-, weakly up-, and up-acceptable program are introduced. We use these notions to develop a methodology for proving termination of general logic programs, and show how interesting problems in non-monotonic reasoning can be formalized and implemented by means of terminating general logic programs. \",\n",
       " ' A Constraint-based Case Frame Lexicon We present a constraint-based case frame lexicon architecture for bi-directional mapping between a syntactic case frame and a semantic frame. The lexicon uses a semantic sense as the basic unit and employs a multi-tiered constraint structure for the resolution of syntactic information into the appropriate senses and/or idiomatic usage. Valency changing transformations such as morphologically marked passivized or causativized forms are handled via lexical rules that manipulate case frames templates. The system has been implemented in a typed-feature system and applied to Turkish. ',\n",

We present evaluations of the system's performance along several different dimensions; these enable us to assess the contribution that each individual part is making to the success of the system as a whole, and thus prioritise the effort to be devoted to its further enhancement. Currently, the system is able to parse around 80% of sentences in a substantial corpus of general text containing a number of distinct genres. On a random sample of 250 such sentences the system has a mean crossing bracket rate of 0.71 and recall and precision of 83% and 84% respectively when evaluated against manually-disambiguated analyses. \",\n",
       " \" Combining Hand-crafted Rules and Unsupervised Learning in Constraint-based Morphological Disambiguation This paper presents a constraint-based morphological disambiguation approach that is applicable languages with complex morphology--specifically agglutinative languages with productive inflectional and derivational morphological phenomena. In certain respects, our approach has been motivated by Brill's recent work, but with the observation that his transformational approach is not directly applicable to languages like Turkish. Our system combines corpus independent hand-crafted constraint rules, constraint rules that are learned via unsupervised learning from a training corpus, and additional statistical information from the corpus to be morphologically disambiguated. The hand-crafted rules are linguistically motivated and tuned to improve precision without sacrificing recall. The unsupervised learning process produces two sets of rules: (i) choose rules which choose morphological parses of a lexical item satisfying constraint effectively discarding other parses, and (ii) delete rules, which delete parses satisfying a constraint. Our approach also uses a novel approach to unknown word processing by employing a secondary morphological processor which recovers any relevant inflectional and derivational information from a lexical item whose root is unknown. With this approach, well below 1 percent of the tokens remains as unknown in the texts we have experimented with. Our results indicate that by combining these hand-crafted,statistical and learned information sources, we can attain a recall of 96 to 97 percent with a corresponding precision of 93 to 94 percent, and ambiguity of 1.02 to 1.03 parses per token. \",\n",

Models are derived by starting with a large and specific model and by successively combining states to build smaller and more general models. We present methods to reduce the time complexity of the algorithm and report on experiments on deriving language models for a speech recognition task. The experiments show the advantage of model merging over the standard bigram approach. The merged model assigns a lower perplexity to the test set and uses considerably fewer states. ',\n",

It has natural language processing applications in searching for matches in example-based translation systems, and retrieval from lexical databases containing entries of complex feature structures. The algorithm has been implemented on SparcStations, and for large randomly generated synthetic tree databases (some having tens of thousands of trees) it can associatively search for trees with a small error, in a matter of tenths of a second to few seconds.

We argue this position with particular regard to the generation of referring expressions. \",\n",
       " ' Collocational Grammar A perspective of statistical language models which emphasizes their collocational aspect is advocated. It is suggested that strings be generalized in terms of classes of relationships instead of classes of objects. The single most important characteristic of such a model is a mechanism for comparing patterns. When patterns are fully generalized a natural definition of syntactic class emerges as a subset of relational class. These collocational syntactic classes should be an unambiguous partition of traditional syntactic classes. ',\n",
       " \" Efficient Algorithms for Parsing the DOP Model Excellent results have been reported for Data-Oriented Parsing DOP of natural language texts (Bod, 1993). Unfortunately, existing algorithms are both computationally intensive and difficult to implement. Previous algorithms are expensive due to two factors: the exponential number of rules that must be generated and the use of a Monte Carlo parsing algorithm. In this paper we solve the first problem by a novel reduction of the DOP model to a small, equivalent probabilistic context-free grammar. We solve the second problem by a novel deterministic parsing strategy that maximizes the expected number of correct constituents, rather than the probability of a correct parse tree. Using the optimizations, experiments yield a 97% crossing brackets rate and 88% zero crossing brackets rate. This differs significantly from the results reported by Bod, and is comparable to results from a duplication of Pereira and Schabes's (1992) experiment on the same data. We show that Bod's results are at least partially due to an extremely fortuitous choice of test data, and partially due to using cleaner data than other researchers. \",\n",
       " ' Another Facet of LIG Parsing In this paper we present a new parsing algorithm for linear indexed grammars (LIGs) in the same spirit as the one described in (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993) for tree adjoining grammars. For a LIG and an input string of length , we build a non ambiguous context-free grammar whose sentences are all (and exclusively) valid derivation sequences in which lead to . We show that this grammar can be built in time and that individual parses can be extracted in linear time with the size of the extracted parse tree. Though this upper bound does not improve over previous results, the average case behaves much better. Moreover, practical parsing times can be decreased by some statically performed computations.

       " ' Multi-level post-processing for Korean character recognition using morphological analysis and linguistic evaluation Most of the post-processing methods for character recognition rely on contextual information of character and word-fragment levels. However, due to linguistic characteristics of Korean, such low-level information alone is not sufficient for high-quality character-recognition applications, and we need much higher-level contextual information to improve the recognition results. This paper presents a domain independent post-processing technique that utilizes multi-level morphological, syntactic, and semantic information as well as character-level information. The proposed post-processing system performs three-level processing: candidate character-set selection, candidate eojeol (Korean word) generation through morphological analysis, and final single eojeol-sequence selection by linguistic evaluation. All the required linguistic information and probabilities are automatically acquired from a statistical corpus analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, yielding error correction rate of 80.46%, and improved recognition rate of 95.53% from before-post-processing rate 71.2% for single best-solution selection.

The LFG-based implementation presented here avoids unnessary structural complexity in the representation of auxiliaries by challenging the traditional analysis of auxiliaries as raising verbs. The approach developed for multiple genitive NPs provides a more abstract, language independent representation of genitives associated with nominalized verbs. Taken together, the two approaches represent a step towards providing uniformly applicable treatments for differing languages, thus lightening the burden for machine translation. ',\n",

       " ' The importance of being lazy -- using lazy evaluation to process queries to HPSG grammars Linguistic theories formulated in the architecture of {\\\\sc hpsg} can be very precise and explicit since {\\\\sc hpsg} provides a formally well-defined setup. However, when querying a faithful implementation of such an explicit theory, the large data structures specified can make it hard to see the relevant aspects of the reply given by the system. Furthermore, the system spends much time applying constraints which can never fail just to be able to enumerate specific answers. In this paper we want to describe lazy evaluation as the result of an off-line compilation technique. This method of evaluation can be used to answer queries to an {\\\\sc hpsg} system so that only the relevant aspects are checked and output. ',\n",

We focus in this paper on the part of the semantic analyser which deals with semantic composition. We explain how we use the domain model to handle metonymy dynamically, and more generally, to underlie semantic composition, using the knowledge descriptions attached to each concept of our ontology as a kind of concept-level, multiple-role qualia structure. We rely for this on a heuristic path search algorithm that exploits the graphic aspects of the conceptual graphs formalism.

These are part of any model formulation procedure, even if not broken out as separate steps, so the tradeoffs explored in this paper are relevant to a wide variety of methods.

       " ' 2Planning for Contingencies: A Decision-based Approach A fundamental assumption made by classical AI planners is that there is no uncertainty in the world: the planner has full knowledge of the conditions under which the plan will be executed and the outcome of every action is fully predictable. These planners cannot therefore construct contingency plans, i.e., plans in which different actions are performed in different circumstances. In this paper we discuss some issues that arise in the representation and construction of contingency plans and describe Cassandra, a partial-order contingency planner. Cassandra uses explicit decision-steps that enable the agent executing the plan to decide which plan branch to follow. The decision-steps in a plan result in subgoals to acquire knowledge, which are planned for in the same way as any other subgoals. Cassandra thus distinguishes the process of gathering information from the process of making decisions. The explicit representation of decisions in Cassandra allows a coherent approach to the problems of contingent planning, and provides a solid base for extensions such as the use of different decision-making procedures.

In adaptive problem-solving solving, domain specific knowledge is acquired automatically for a general problem solver with a flexible control architecture. In this approach, a learning system explores a space of possible heuristic methods for one well-suited to the eccentricities of the given domain and problem distribution. In this article, we discuss an application of the approach to scheduling satellite communications.

In this paper, we develop a formal framework for learning efficient problem solving from random problems and their solutions.

Our proofs are constructive in that they are accompanied with learning algorithms. Our framework captures both empirical and explanation-based speedup learning in a unified fashion. We illustrate our framework with implementations in two domains: symbolic integration and Eight Puzzle.

       " ' A Model-Theoretic Framework for Theories of Syntax A natural next step in the evolution of constraint-based grammar formalisms from rewriting formalisms is to abstract fully away from the details of the grammar mechanism---to express syntactic theories purely in terms of the properties of the class of structures they license. By focusing on the structural properties of languages rather than on mechanisms for generating or checking structures that exhibit those properties, this model-theoretic approach can offer simpler and significantly clearer expression of theories and can potentially provide a uniform formalization, allowing disparate theories to be compared on the basis of those properties. We discuss , a monadic second-order logical framework for such an approach to syntax that has the distinctive virtue of being superficially expressive---supporting direct statement of most linguistically significant syntactic properties---but having well-defined strong generative capacity---languages are definable in iff they are strongly context-free.

A~systematic procedure is presented for post-processing decision trees produced by C4.5. This procedure was derived by rejecting Occam's razor and instead attending to the assumption that similar objects are likely to belong to the same class. It increases a decision tree's complexity without altering the performance of that tree on the training data from which it is inferred. The resulting more complex decision trees are demonstrated to have, on average, for a variety of common learning tasks, higher predictive accuracy than the less complex original decision trees. This result raises considerable doubt about the utility of Occam's razor as it is commonly applied in modern machine learning. \",\n",

In this paper, we give a systematic treatment of the existence or non-existence of least generalizations and greatest specializations of finite sets of clauses in each of these six ordered sets. We survey results already obtained by others and also contribute some answers of our own. Our main new results are, firstly, the existence of a computable least generalization under implication of every finite set of clauses containing at least one non-tautologous function-free clause (among other, not necessarily function-free clauses). Secondly, we show that such a least generalization need not exist under relative implication, not even if both the set that is to be generalized and the background knowledge are function-free.

S-forms, which we introduce in this paper, are a scoped version of U-forms, and we define a compositional semantics mechanism for them. Two types of semantic composition are basic: complement incorporation and modifier incorporation. Binding of variables is done at the time of incorporation, permitting much flexibility in composition order and a simple account of the semantic effects of permuting several incorporations. \",\n",

In semidirectional Lambek calculus there is an additional non-directional abstraction rule allowing the formula abstracted over to appear anywhere in the premise sequent's left-hand side, thus permitting non-peripheral extraction. grammars are able to generate each context-free language and more than that. We show that the parsing problem for semidirectional Lambek Grammar is NP-complete by a reduction of the 3-Partition problem. \",\n",

This paper reports on the application of a few simple, yet robust and efficient noun-phrase analysis techniques to create better indexing phrases for information retrieval. In particular, we describe a hybrid approach to the extraction of meaningful (continuous or discontinuous) subcompounds from complex noun phrases using both corpus statistics and linguistic heuristics. Results of experiments show that indexing based on such extracted subcompounds improves both recall and precision in an information retrieval system. The noun-phrase analysis techniques are also potentially useful for book indexing and automatic thesaurus extraction. ',\n",

We present simulation results with three simple classifiers - an ordinary nearest neighbour algorithm, Nosofsky's `Generalized Context Model' GCM and a standard, three-layer backprop network - predicting the plural class from a phonological representation of the singular in German. Though these are absolutely `minimal' models, in terms of architecture and input information, they nevertheless do remarkably well. The nearest neighbour predicts the correct plural class with an accuracy of 72% for a set of 24,640 nouns from the CELEX database. With a subset of 8,598 (non-compound) nouns, the nearest neighbour, the GCM and the network score 71.0%, 75.0% and 83.5%, respectively, on novel items. Furthermore, they outperform a hybrid, `pattern-associator + default rule', model, as proposed by Marcus et al. (1995), on this data set. \",\n",

       " \" Learning Word Association Norms Using Tree Cut Pair Models We consider the problem of learning co-occurrence information between two word categories, or more in general between two discrete random variables taking values in a hierarchically classified domain. In particular, we consider the problem of learning the `association norm' defined by A(x,y)=p(x, y)/(p(x)*p(y)), where p(x, y) is the joint distribution for x and y and p(x) and p(y) are marginal distributions induced by p(x, y). We formulate this problem as a sub-task of learning the conditional distribution p(x|y), by exploiting the identity p(x|y) = A(x,y)*p(x). We propose a two-step estimation method based on the MDL principle, which works as follows: It first estimates p(x) as p1 using MDL, and then estimates p(x|y) for a fixed y by applying MDL on the hypothesis class of {A * p1 | A \\\\in B} for some given class B of representations for association norm. The estimation of A is therefore obtained as a side-effect of a near optimal estimation of p(x|y). We then apply this general framework to the problem of acquiring case-frame patterns. We assume that both p(x) and A(x, y) for given y are representable by a model based on a classification that exists within an existing thesaurus tree as a `cut,' and hence p(x|y) is represented as the product of a pair of `tree cut models.' We then devise an efficient algorithm that implements our general strategy. We tested our method by using it to actually acquire case-frame patterns and conducted disambiguation experiments using the acquired knowledge. The experimental results show that our method improves upon existing methods. \",\n",

LR-compiling techniques are used to allow a recursive-descent generation algorithm to perform functor merging much in the same way as an LR parser performs prefix merging. This is an improvement on the semantic-head-driven generator that results in a much smaller search space. The amount of semantic lookahead can be varied, and appropriate tradeoff points between table size and resulting nondeterminism can be found automatically. This can be done by removing all spurious nondeterminism for input sufficiently close to the examples of a training corpus, and large portions of it for other input, while preserving completeness.

By choosing a parsing algorithm appropriate for the evaluation metric, better performance can be achieved. We present two new algorithms: the ``Labelled Recall Algorithm,'' which maximizes the expected Labelled Recall Rate, and the ``Bracketed Recall Algorithm,'' which maximizes the Bracketed Recall Rate. Experimental results are given, showing that the two new algorithms have improved performance over the Viterbi algorithm on many criteria, especially the ones that they optimize. \",\n",
       " ' A Principled Approach Towards Symbolic Geometric Constraint Satisfaction An important problem in geometric reasoning is to find the configuration of a collection of geometric bodies so as to satisfy a set of given constraints. Recently, it has been suggested that this problem can be solved efficiently by symbolically reasoning about geometry. This approach, called degrees of freedom analysis, employs a set of specialized routines called plan fragments that specify how to change the configuration of a set of bodies to satisfy a new constraint while preserving existing constraints. A potential drawback, which limits the scalability of this approach, is concerned with the difficulty of writing plan fragments. In this paper we address this limitation by showing how these plan fragments can be automatically synthesized using first principles about geometric bodies, actions, and topology. ',\n",
       " \" On Partially Controlled Multi-Agent Systems Motivated by the control theoretic distinction between controllable and uncontrollable events, we distinguish between two types of agents within a multi-agent system: controllable agents, which are directly controlled by the system's designer, and uncontrollable agents, which are not under the designer's direct control. We refer to such systems as partially controlled multi-agent systems, and we investigate how one might influence the behavior of the uncontrolled agents through appropriate design of the controlled agents. In particular, we wish to understand which problems are naturally described in these terms, what methods can be applied to influence the uncontrollable agents, the effectiveness of such methods, and whether similar methods work across different domains. Using a game-theoretic framework, this paper studies the design of partially controlled multi-agent systems in two contexts: in one context, the uncontrollable agents are expected utility maximizers, while in the other they are reinforcement learners. We suggest different techniques for controlling agents' behavior in each domain, assess their success, and examine their relationship. \",\n",

Generating all parses is inefficient and obscures whatever true semantic ambiguities are in the input. This paper addresses the problem for a fairly general form of Combinatory Categorial Grammar, by means of an efficient, correct, and easy to implement normal-form parsing technique. The parser is proved to find exactly one parse in each semantic equivalence class of allowable parses; that is, spurious ambiguity (as carefully defined) is shown to be both safely and completely eliminated.

       " \" A Bayesian hybrid method for context-sensitive spelling correction Two classes of methods have been shown to be useful for resolving lexical ambiguity. The first relies on the presence of particular words within some distance of the ambiguous target word; the second uses the pattern of words and part-of-speech tags around the target word. These methods have complementary coverage: the former captures the lexical ``atmosphere'' (discourse topic, tense, etc.), while the latter captures local syntax. Yarowsky has exploited this complementarity by combining the two methods using decision lists. The idea is to pool the evidence provided by the component methods, and to then solve a target problem by applying the single strongest piece of evidence, whatever type it happens to be. This paper takes Yarowsky's work as a starting point, applying decision lists to the problem of context-sensitive spelling correction. Decision lists are found, by and large, to outperform either component method. However, it is found that further improvements can be obtained by taking into account not just the single strongest piece of evidence, but ALL the available evidence. A new hybrid method, based on Bayesian classifiers, is presented for doing this, and its performance improvements are demonstrated. \",\n",
       " \" Combining Trigram-based and Feature-based Methods for Context-Sensitive Spelling Correction This paper addresses the problem of correcting spelling errors that result in valid, though unintended words (such as ``peace'' and ``piece'', or ``quiet'' and ``quite'') and also the problem of correcting particular word usage errors (such as ``amount'' and ``number'', or ``among'' and ``between''). Such corrections require contextual information and are not handled by conventional spelling programs such as Unix `spell'. First, we introduce a method called Trigrams that uses part-of-speech trigrams to encode the context. This method uses a small number of parameters compared to previous methods based on word trigrams. However, it is effectively unable to distinguish among words that have the same part of speech. For this case, an alternative feature-based method called Bayes performs better; but Bayes is less effective than Trigrams when the distinction among words depends on syntactic constraints. A hybrid method called Tribayes is then introduced that combines the best of the previous two methods. The improvement in performance of Tribayes over its components is verified experimentally. Tribayes is also compared with the grammar checker in Microsoft Word, and is found to have substantially higher performance. \",\n",

We show that this algorithm is efficient and that it performs well with respect to a number of standard problems for default inheritance. A prototype implementation has been tested on lexical hierarchies and it has produced encouraging results. The work presented here is also relevant to other types of default hierarchies. ',\n",

The contexts range from standard bigram and trigram contexts to part of speech five-grams. Although none of the models can compete directly with a backoff trigram, they give up to 9\\\\% improvement in perplexity when interpolated with a trigram.

On the other hand, we have considered the conjunction {\\\\em et (and)} as the head of the coordinate structure, so that coordinate structures stem simply from the subcategorization specifications of {\\\\em et} and the general schemata of a head saturation.

This method takes dependent disjunctions within a constraint formula and factors them into non-interacting groups whenever possible by determining their independence. When a group of dependent disjunctions is split into smaller groups, an exponential amount of redundant information is reduced. At runtime, this means that an exponential amount of processing can be saved as well. Since the performance of an algorithm for processing constraints with dependent disjunctions is highly determined by its input, the transformation presented in this paper should prove beneficial for all such algorithms.

A POS hand-tagged corpus of 348,000 words is used. The corpus is being tagged in two steps. First, possible semantic tags are selected from a semantic dictionary(Tong Yi Ci Ci Lin), the POS and the conditional probability of semantic from POS, i.e., P(S|P). The final semantic tag is then assigned by considering the semantic tags before and after the current word and the semantic-word conditional probability P(S|W) derived from the first step. Semantic bigram probabilities P(S|S) are used in the second step. Final manual checking shows that this simple but efficient algorithm has a hit rate of 91%. The tagger tags 142 words per second, using a 120 MHz Pentium running FOXPRO. It runs about 2.3 times faster than a Viterbi tagger. ',\n",

We describe techniques for improving the modeling of language at each of these levels, and surpass the performance of existing algorithms for each problem. We approach the three problems using three different frameworks. We relate each of these frameworks to the Bayesian paradigm, and show why each framework used was appropriate for the given problem. Finally, we show how our research addresses two central issues in probabilistic modeling: the sparse data problem and the problem of inducing hidden structure. ',\n",

Each leaf node can then be treated as a separate rule where the left and right contexts are constructable from the decisions made traversing the tree from the root to the leaf.

We segment Chinese text into words based on a word-based Chinese language model. However, the construction of a Chinese LM itself requires word boundaries. To get out of the chicken-and-egg problem, we propose an iterative procedure that alternates two operations: segmenting text into words and building an LM. Starting with an initial segmented corpus and an LM based upon it, we use a Viterbi-liek algorithm to segment another set of data. Then, we build an LM based on the second set and use the resulting LM to segment again the first corpus. The alternating procedure provides a self-organized way for the segmenter to detect automatically unseen words and correct segmentation errors. Our preliminary experiment shows that the alternating procedure not only improves the accuracy of our segmentation, but discovers unseen words surprisingly well. The resulting word-based LM has a perplexity of 188 for a general Chinese corpus. ',\n",

       " ' Two Questions about Data-Oriented Parsing In this paper I present ongoing work on the data-oriented parsing DOP model. In previous work, DOP was tested on a cleaned-up set of analyzed part-of-speech strings from the Penn Treebank, achieving excellent test results. This left, however, two important questions unanswered: (1) how does DOP perform if tested on unedited data, and (2) how can DOP be used for parsing word strings that contain unknown words? This paper addresses these questions. We show that parse results on unedited data are worse than on cleaned-up data, although very competitive if compared to other models. As to the parsing of word strings, we show that the hardness of the problem does not so much depend on unknown words, but on previously unseen lexical categories of known words. We give a novel method for parsing these words by estimating the probabilities of unknown subtrees. The method is of general interest since it shows that good performance can be obtained without the use of a part-of-speech tagger. To the best of our knowledge, our method outperforms other statistical parsers tested on Penn Treebank word strings. ',\n",

In contrast to the simple replace expression, UPPER -> LOWER, defined in Karttunen (ACL-95), the new directed version, UPPER @-> LOWER, yields an unambiguous transducer if the lower language consists of a single string. It transduces the input string from left to right, making only the longest possible replacement at each point. A new type of replacement expression, UPPER @-> PREFIX ... SUFFIX, yields a transducer that inserts text around strings that are instances of UPPER. The symbol ... denotes the matching part of the input which itself remains unchanged. PREFIX and SUFFIX are regular expressions describing the insertions. Expressions of the type UPPER @-> PREFIX ... SUFFIX may be used to compose a deterministic parser for a ``local grammar'' in the sense of Gross (1989). Other useful applications of directed replacement include tokenization and filtering of text streams. \",\n",
       " ' Minimizing Manual Annotation Cost In Supervised Training From Corpora Corpus-based methods for natural language processing often use supervised training, requiring expensive manual annotation of training corpora. This paper investigates methods for reducing annotation cost by {\\\\it sample selection}. In this approach, during training the learning program examines many unlabeled examples and selects for labeling (annotation) only those that are most informative at each stage. This avoids redundantly annotating examples that contribute little new information. This paper extends our previous work on {\\\\it committee-based sample selection} for probabilistic classifiers. We describe a family of methods for committee-based sample selection, and report experimental results for the task of stochastic part-of-speech tagging. We find that all variants achieve a significant reduction in annotation cost, though their computational efficiency differs. In particular, the simplest method, which has no parameters to tune, gives excellent results. We also show that sample selection yields a significant reduction in the size of the model used by the tagger. ',\n",
       " ' Context-Sensitive Measurement of Word Distance by Adaptive Scaling of a Semantic Space The paper proposes a computationally feasible method for measuring context-sensitive semantic distance between words. The distance is computed by adaptive scaling of a semantic space. In the semantic space, each word in the vocabulary V is represented by a multi-dimensional vector which is obtained from an English dictionary through a principal component analysis. Given a word set C which specifies a context for measuring word distance, each dimension of the semantic space is scaled up or down according to the distribution of C in the semantic space. In the space thus transformed, distance between words in V becomes dependent on the context C. An evaluation through a word prediction task shows that the proposed measurement successfully extracts the context of a text. ',\n",

       " ' Domain and Language Independent Feature Extraction for Statistical Text Categorization A generic system for text categorization is presented which uses a representative text corpus to adapt the processing steps: feature extraction, dimension reduction, and classification. Feature extraction automatically learns features from the corpus by reducing actual word forms using statistical information of the corpus and general linguistic knowledge. The dimension of feature vector is then reduced by linear transformation keeping the essential information. The classification principle is a minimum least square approach based on polynomials. The described system can be readily adapted to new domains or new languages. In application, the system is reliable, fast, and processes completely automatically. It is shown that the text categorizer works successfully both on text generated by document image analysis - DIA and on ground truth data. ',\n",

We show that, though the use of LRs is justified, they do not come cost-free. Semi-automatic output checking is required, even with blocking and preemtion procedures built in. Nevertheless, large-scope LRs are justified because they facilitate the unavoidable process of large-scale semi-automatic lexical acquisition.

       " ' Learning similarity-based word sense disambiguation from sparse data We describe a method for automatic word sense disambiguation using a text corpus and a machine-readable dictionary MRD. The method is based on word similarity and context similarity measures. Words are considered similar if they appear in similar contexts; contexts are similar if they contain similar words. The circularity of this definition is resolved by an iterative, converging process, in which the system learns from the corpus a set of typical usages for each of the senses of the polysemous word listed in the MRD. A new instance of a polysemous word is assigned the sense associated with the typical usage most similar to its context. Experiments show that this method performs well, and can learn even from very sparse training data. ',\n",
       " ' MBT: A Memory-Based Part of Speech Tagger-Generator We introduce a memory-based approach to part of speech tagging. Memory-based learning is a form of supervised learning based on similarity-based reasoning. The part of speech tag of a word in a particular context is extrapolated from the most similar cases held in memory. Supervised learning approaches are useful when a tagged corpus is available as an example of the desired output of the tagger. Based on such a corpus, the tagger-generator automatically builds a tagger which is able to tag new text the same way, diminishing development time for the construction of a tagger considerably. Memory-based tagging shares this advantage with other statistical or machine learning approaches. Additional advantages specific to a memory-based approach include (i) the relatively small tagged corpus size sufficient for training, (ii) incremental learning, (iii) explanation capabilities, (iv) flexible integration of information in case representations, (v) its non-parametric nature, (vi) reasonably good results on unknown words without morphological analysis, and (vii) fast learning and tagging. In this paper we show that a large-scale application of the memory-based approach is feasible: we obtain a tagging accuracy that is on a par with that of known statistical approaches, and with attractive space and time complexity properties when using {\\\\em IGTree}, a tree-based formalism for indexing and searching huge case bases.} The use of IGTree has as additional advantage that optimal context size for disambiguation is dynamically computed.

       " \" A Divide-and-Conquer Strategy for Parsing In this paper, we propose a novel strategy which is designed to enhance the accuracy of the parser by simplifying complex sentences before parsing. This approach involves the separate parsing of the constituent sub-sentences within a complex sentence. To achieve that, the divide-and-conquer strategy first disambiguates the roles of the link words in the sentence and segments the sentence based on these roles. The separate parse trees of the segmented sub-sentences and the noun phrases within them are then synthesized to form the final parse. To evaluate the effects of this strategy on parsing, we compare the original performance of a dependency parser with the performance when it is enhanced with the divide-and-conquer strategy. When tested on 600 sentences of the IPSM'95 data sets, the enhanced parser saw a considerable error reduction of 21.2% in its accuracy. \",\n",

       " ' Morphological Analysis as Classification: an Inductive-Learning Approach Morphological analysis is an important subtask in text-to-speech conversion, hyphenation, and other language engineering tasks. The traditional approach to performing morphological analysis is to combine a morpheme lexicon, sets of (linguistic) rules, and heuristics to find a most probable analysis. In contrast we present an inductive learning approach in which morphological analysis is reformulated as a segmentation task. We report on a number of experiments in which five inductive learning algorithms are applied to three variations of the task of morphological analysis. Results show (i) that the generalisation performance of the algorithms is good, and (ii) that the lazy learning algorithm IB1-IG performs best on all three tasks. We conclude that lazy learning of morphological analysis as a classification task is indeed a viable approach; moreover, it has the strong advantages over the traditional approach of avoiding the knowledge-acquisition bottleneck, being fast and deterministic in learning and processing, and being language-independent.

This is the task of fixing spelling errors that happen to result in valid words, such as substituting {\\\\it to\\\\/} for {\\\\it too}, {\\\\it casual\\\\/} for {\\\\it causal}, and so on. Previous approaches to this problem have been statistics-based; we compare Winnow to one of the more successful such approaches, which uses Bayesian classifiers. We find that: (1)~When the standard (heavily-pruned) set of features is used to describe problem instances, Winnow performs comparably to the Bayesian method; (2)~When the full (unpruned) set of features is used, Winnow is able to exploit the new features and convincingly outperform Bayes; and (3)~When a test set is encountered that is dissimilar to the training set, Winnow is better than Bayes at adapting to the unfamiliar test set, using a strategy we will present for combining learning on the training set with unsupervised learning on the (noisy) test set.

This squib claims that Large-scale Automatic Sense Tagging of text LAST can be done at a high-level of accuracy and with far less complexity and computational effort than has been believed until now. Moreover, it can be done for all open class words, and not just carefully selected opposed pairs as in some recent work. We describe two experiments: one exploring the amount of information relevant to sense disambiguation which is contained in the part-of-speech field of entries in Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English LDOCE.

       " \" Using Multiple Sources of Information for Constraint-Based Morphological Disambiguation This thesis presents a constraint-based morphological disambiguation approach that is applicable to languages with complex morphology--specifically agglutinative languages with productive inflectional and derivational morphological phenomena. For morphologically complex languages like Turkish, automatic morphological disambiguation involves selecting for each token morphological parse(s), with the right set of inflectional and derivational markers. Our system combines corpus independent hand-crafted constraint rules, constraint rules that are learned via unsupervised learning from a training corpus, and additional statistical information obtained from the corpus to be morphologically disambiguated. The hand-crafted rules are linguistically motivated and tuned to improve precision without sacrificing recall. In certain respects, our approach has been motivated by Brill's recent work, but with the observation that his transformational approach is not directly applicable to languages like Turkish. Our approach also uses a novel approach to unknown word processing by employing a secondary morphological processor which recovers any relevant inflectional and derivational information from a lexical item whose root is unknown. With this approach, well below 1% of the tokens remains as unknown in the texts we have experimented with. Our results indicate that by combining these hand-crafted, statistical and learned information sources, we can attain a recall of 96 to 97% with a corresponding precision of 93 to 94%, and ambiguity of 1.02 to 1.03 parses per token. \",\n",

       " ' Spatial Aggregation: Theory and Applications Visual thinking plays an important role in scientific reasoning. Based on the research in automating diverse reasoning tasks about dynamical systems, nonlinear controllers, kinematic mechanisms, and fluid motion, we have identified a style of visual thinking, imagistic reasoning. Imagistic reasoning organizes computations around image-like, analogue representations so that perceptual and symbolic operations can be brought to bear to infer structure and behavior. Programs incorporating imagistic reasoning have been shown to perform at an expert level in domains that defy current analytic or numerical methods. We have developed a computational paradigm, spatial aggregation, to unify the description of a class of imagistic problem solvers. A program written in this paradigm has the following properties. It takes a continuous field and optional objective functions as input, and produces high-level descriptions of structure, behavior, or control actions. It computes a multi-layer of intermediate representations, called spatial aggregates, by forming equivalence classes and adjacency relations. It employs a small set of generic operators such as aggregation, classification, and localization to perform bidirectional mapping between the information-rich field and successively more abstract spatial aggregates. It uses a data structure, the neighborhood graph, as a common interface to modularize computations. To illustrate our theory, we describe the computational structure of three implemented problem solvers -- KAM, MAPS, and HIPAIR --- in terms of the spatial aggregation generic operators by mixing and matching a library of commonly used routines.

Parallel replacement allows multiple replacements to apply simultaneously to the same input without interfering with each other.

With these enhancements, the general replacement expressions are more versatile than two-level rules for the description of complex morphological alternations. ',\n",

Such correlations, that I had proposed in earlier work (COLING 90), are verified through the analysis of a corpus of naturally occurring texts. In the process, I extend my previous analysis in several ways, for example by taking possessives and subordinates into account. I also provide a more detailed analysis of the continue transition: more specifically, I show that pronouns are used in a markedly different way in a continue preceded by another continue or by a shift , and in a continue preceded by a retain .

After a general introduction to the Italian pronominal system, I will review centering, and then show how the original rules have to be extended or modified. Finally, I will show that centering does not account for two phenomena: first, the functional role of an utterance may override the predictions of centering; second, a null subject can be used to refer to a whole discourse segment.

In particular, our approach generalizes the algorithm originally proposed by Dedina and Nusbaum (D&N) (1991), which had originally been promoted as a model of the human ability to pronounce unknown words by analogy to familiar lexical items. We will show that DN's algorithm performs comparatively poorly when evaluated on a realistic test set, and that our extension allows us to improve substantially the performance of the analogy-based model. We will also suggest that both algorithms can be reformulated in a much more general framework, which allows us to anticipate other useful extensions. However, considering the inability to define in these models important notions like lexical neighborhood, we conclude that both approaches fail to offer a proper model of the analogical processes involved in reading aloud. \",\n",

This paper suggests that Fisher's exact test is a more appropriate test due to the skewed and sparse data samples typical of this problem. Both theoretical and experimental comparisons between Fisher's exact test and a variety of asymptotic tests (the t-test, Pearson's chi-square test, and Likelihood-ratio chi-square test) are presented. These comparisons show that Fisher's exact test is more reliable in identifying dependent word pairs. The usefulness of Fisher's exact test extends to other problems in statistical natural language processing as skewed and sparse data appears to be the rule in natural language. The experiment presented in this paper was performed using PROC FREQ of the SAS System. \",\n",

Thus, it might seem that the quotation marks would be extremely useful in identifying these structures in texts. Unfortunately, the situation is not quite so clear. In this work, I will argue that quotation marks are not adequate for either identifying or constraining the syntax of quoted speech. More useful information comes from the presence of a quoting verb, which is either a verb of saying or a punctual verb, and the presence of other punctuation marks, usually commas. Using a lexicalized grammar, we can license most quoting clauses as text adjuncts. A distinction will be made not between direct and indirect quoted speech, but rather between adjunct and non-adjunct quoting clauses. ',\n",

       " ' Morphological Productivity in the Lexicon In this paper we outline a lexical organization for Turkish that makes use of lexical rules for inflections, derivations, and lexical category changes to control the proliferation of lexical entries. Lexical rules handle changes in grammatical roles, enforce type constraints, and control the mapping of subcategorization frames in valency-changing operations. A lexical inheritance hierarchy facilitates the enforcement of type constraints. Semantic compositions in inflections and derivations are constrained by the properties of the terms and predicates. The design has been tested as part of a HPSG grammar for Turkish. In terms of performance, run-time execution of the rules seems to be a far better alternative than pre-compilation. The latter causes exponential growth in the lexicon due to intensive use of inflections and derivations in Turkish. ',\n",

In view of this, the current work also attempts to create shorter alignment pairs by permitting finer matching between clauses from both texts if possible.

This paper presents some difficulties incurred, along with their proposed solutions, in the extension of phonetic confusion results to a theoretical whole-word phonetic distance metric.

       " \" Phonetic Ambiguity : Approaches, Touchstones, Pitfalls and New Approaches Phonetic ambiguity and confusibility are bugbears for any form of bottom-up or data-driven approach to language processing. The question of when an input is ``close enough'' to a target word pervades the entire problem spaces of speech recognition, synthesis, language acquisition, speech compression, and language representation, but the variety of representations that have been applied are demonstrably inadequate to at least some aspects of the problem. This paper reviews this inadequacy by examining several touchstone models in phonetic ambiguity and relating them to the problems they were designed to solve. An good solution would be, among other things, efficient, accurate, precise, and universally applicable to representation of words, ideally usable as a ``phonetic distance'' metric for direct measurement of the ``distance'' between word or utterance pairs. None of the proposed models can provide a complete solution to the problem; in general, there is no algorithmic theory of phonetic distance. It is unclear whether this is a weakness of our representational technology or a more fundamental difficulty with the problem statement. \",\n",
       " \" Using sentence connectors for evaluating MT output This paper elaborates on the design of a machine translation evaluation method that aims to determine to what degree the meaning of an original text is preserved in translation, without looking into the grammatical correctness of its constituent sentences. The basic idea is to have a human evaluator take the sentences of the translated text and, for each of these sentences, determine the semantic relationship that exists between it and the sentence immediately preceding it. In order to minimise evaluator dependence, relations between sentences are expressed in terms of the conjuncts that can connect them, rather than through explicit categories. For an n-sentence text this results in a list of n-1 sentence-to-sentence relationships, which we call the text's connectivity profile. This can then be compared to the connectivity profile of the original text, and the degree of correspondence between the two would be a measure for the quality of the translation. A set of essential conjuncts was extracted for English and Japanese, and a computer interface was designed to support the task of inserting the most fitting conjuncts between sentence pairs. With these in place, several sets of experiments were performed. \",\n",
       " \" Accelerating Partial-Order Planners: Some Techniques for Effective Search Control and Pruning We propose some domain-independent techniques for bringing well-founded partial-order planners closer to practicality. The first two techniques are aimed at improving search control while keeping overhead costs low. One is based on a simple adjustment to the default A* heuristic used by UCPOP to select plans for refinement. The other is based on preferring ``zero commitment'' (forced) plan refinements whenever possible, and using LIFO prioritization otherwise. A more radical technique is the use of operator parameter domains to prune search. These domains are initially computed from the definitions of the operators and the initial and goal conditions, using a polynomial-time algorithm that propagates sets of constants through the operator graph, starting in the initial conditions. During planning, parameter domains can be used to prune nonviable operator instances and to remove spurious clobbering threats. In experiments based on modifications of UCPOP, our improved plan and goal selection strategies gave speedups by factors ranging from 5 to more than 1000 for a variety of problems that are nontrivial for the unmodified version. Crucially, the hardest problems gave the greatest improvements. The pruning technique based on parameter domains often gave speedups by an order of magnitude or more for difficult problems, both with the default UCPOP search strategy and with our improved strategy. The Lisp code for our techniques and for the test problems is provided in on-line appendices. \",\n",

Correctly classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential is critical in natural language processing systems that exploit discourse structure, e.g., for performing tasks such as anaphora resolution and plan recognition. This paper explores the use of machine learning for classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential.

It expands on previous work by showing that logical consistency is a necessary indicator of acceptance, but that it is not sufficient, and that logical inconsistency is sufficient as an indicator of rejection, but it is not necessary. I show how conversants can use information structure and prosody as well as logical reasoning in distinguishing between acceptances and logically consistent rejections, and relate this work to previous work on implicature and default reasoning by introducing three new classes of rejection: {\\\\sc implicature rejections}, {\\\\sc epistemic rejections} and {\\\\sc deliberation rejections}. I show how these rejections are inferred as a result of default inferences, which, by other analyses, would have been blocked by the context. In order to account for these facts, I propose a model of the common ground that allows these default inferences to go through, and show how the model, originally proposed to account for the various forms of acceptance, can also model all types of rejection.

Finite-state transducers have been shown recently both to constitute a very useful abstract model and to lead to highly efficient time and space algorithms in this field.

In addition to classical techniques, we describe many new algorithms such as minimization, global and local on-the-fly determinization of weighted automata, and efficient composition of transducers. These methods are currently used in large vocabulary speech recognition systems. We then show how the same formalism and algorithms can be used in text-to-speech applications and related areas of language processing such as morphology, syntax, and local grammars, in a very efficient way. The tutorial is self-contained and requires no specific computational or linguistic knowledge other than classical results. ',\n",
       " \" A Principled Framework for Constructing Natural Language Interfaces To Temporal Databases Most existing natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs) were designed to be used with ``snapshot'' database systems, that provide very limited facilities for manipulating time-dependent data. Consequently, most NLIDBs also provide very limited support for the notion of time. The database community is becoming increasingly interested in _temporal_ database systems. These are intended to store and manipulate in a principled manner information not only about the present, but also about the past and future. This thesis develops a principled framework for constructing English NLIDBs for _temporal_ databases (NLITDBs), drawing on research in tense and aspect theories, temporal logics, and temporal databases. I first explore temporal linguistic phenomena that are likely to appear in English questions to NLITDBs. Drawing on existing linguistic theories of time, I formulate an account for a large number of these phenomena that is simple enough to be embodied in practical NLITDBs. Exploiting ideas from temporal logics, I then define a temporal meaning representation language, TOP, and I show how the HPSG grammar theory can be modified to incorporate the tense and aspect account of this thesis, and to map a wide range of English questions involving time to appropriate TOP expressions. Finally, I present and prove the correctness of a method to translate from TOP to TSQL2, TSQL2 being a temporal extension of the SQL-92 database language. This way, I establish a sound route from English questions involving time to a general-purpose temporal database language, that can act as a principled framework for building NLITDBs. To demonstrate that this framework is workable, I employ it to develop a prototype NLITDB, implemented using ALE and Prolog. \",\n",
       " ' Centering in Japanese Discourse In this paper we propose a computational treatment of the resolution of zero pronouns in Japanese discourse, using an adaptation of the centering algorithm. We are able to factor language-specific dependencies into one parameter of the centering algorithm. Previous analyses have stipulated that a zero pronoun and its cospecifier must share a grammatical function property such as {\\\\sc Subject} or {\\\\sc NonSubject}. We show that this property-sharing stipulation is unneeded. In addition we propose the notion of {\\\\sc topic ambiguity} within the centering framework, which predicts some ambiguities that occur in Japanese discourse. This analysis has implications for the design of language-independent discourse modules for Natural Language systems. The centering algorithm has been implemented in an HPSG Natural Language system with both English and Japanese grammars. ',\n",
       " ' Discourse Coherence and Shifting Centers in Japanese Texts In languages such as Japanese, the use of {\\\\it zeros}, unexpressed arguments of the verb, in utterances that shift the topic involves a risk that the meaning intended by the speaker may not be transparent to the hearer. However, this potentially undesirable conversational strategy often occurs in the course of naturally-occurring discourse. In this chapter, I report on an empirical study of 250 utterances with {\\\\it zeros} in 20 Japanese newspaper articles. Each utterance is analyzed in terms of centering transitions and the form in which centers are realized by referring expressions. I also examine lexical subcategorization information, and tense and aspect in order to test the hypothesis that the speaker expects the hearer to use this information in determining global discourse structure. I explain the occurrence of {\\\\it zeros} in {\\\\sc retain} and {\\\\sc rough-shift} centering transitions, by claiming that a {\\\\it zero} can only be used in these cases when the shift of centers is supported by contextual information such as lexical semantics, tense and aspect, and agreement features. I then propose an algorithm by which centering can incorporate these observations to integrate centering with global discourse structure, and thus enhance its ability for non-local pronoun resolution.

       " \" Japanese Discourse and the Process of Centering This paper has three aims: (1) to generalize a computational account of the discourse process called {\\\\sc centering}, (2) to apply this account to discourse processing in Japanese so that it can be used in computational systems for machine translation or language understanding, and (3) to provide some insights on the effect of syntactic factors in Japanese on discourse interpretation. We argue that while discourse interpretation is an inferential process, syntactic cues constrain this process, and demonstrate this argument with respect to the interpretation of {\\\\sc zeros}, unexpressed arguments of the verb, in Japanese. The syntactic cues in Japanese discourse that we investigate are the morphological markers for grammatical {\\\\sc topic}, the postposition {\\\\it wa}, as well as those for grammatical functions such as {\\\\sc subject}, {\\\\em ga}, {\\\\sc object}, {\\\\em o} and {\\\\sc object2}, {\\\\em ni}. In addition, we investigate the role of speaker's {\\\\sc empathy}, which is the viewpoint from which an event is described. This is syntactically indicated through the use of verbal compounding, i.e. the auxiliary use of verbs such as {\\\\it kureta, kita}. Our results are based on a survey of native speakers of their interpretation of short discourses, consisting of minimal pairs, varied by one of the above factors. We demonstrate that these syntactic cues do indeed affect the interpretation of {\\\\sc zeros}, but that having previously been the {\\\\sc topic} and being realized as a {\\\\sc zero} also contributes to the salience of a discourse entity. We propose a discourse rule of {\\\\sc zero topic assignment}, and show that {\\\\sc centering} provides constraints on when a {\\\\sc zero} can be interpreted as the {\\\\sc zero topic}. \",\n",
       " \" A Probabilistic Disambiguation Method Based on Psycholinguistic Principles We address the problem of structural disambiguation in syntactic parsing. In psycholinguistics, a number of principles of disambiguation have been proposed, notably the Lexical Preference Rule LPR, the Right Association Principle RAP, and the Attach Low and Parallel Principle ALPP (an extension of RAP). We argue that in order to improve disambiguation results it is necessary to implement these principles on the basis of a probabilistic methodology. We define a `three-word probability' for implementing LPR, and a `length probability' for implementing RAP and ALPP. Furthermore, we adopt the `back-off' method to combine these two types of probabilities. Our experimental results indicate our method to be effective, attaining an accuracy of 89.2%. \",\n",

We empirically compared the performance of our method based on the MDL Principle against that of one based on the Maximum Likelihood Estimator, and found that the former outperforms the latter. We also evaluated the method by conducting pp-attachment disambiguation experiments using an automatically constructed thesaurus. Our experimental results indicate that we can improve accuracy in disambiguation by using such a thesaurus. ',\n",
       " ' Designing Statistical Language Learners: Experiments on Noun Compounds The goal of this thesis is to advance the exploration of the statistical language learning design space. In pursuit of that goal, the thesis makes two main theoretical contributions: (i) it identifies a new class of designs by specifying an architecture for natural language analysis in which probabilities are given to semantic forms rather than to more superficial linguistic elements; and (ii) it explores the development of a mathematical theory to predict the expected accuracy of statistical language learning systems in terms of the volume of data used to train them. The theoretical work is illustrated by applying statistical language learning designs to the analysis of noun compounds. Both syntactic and semantic analysis of noun compounds are attempted using the proposed architecture. Empirical comparisons demonstrate that the proposed syntactic model is significantly better than those previously suggested, approaching the performance of human judges on the same task, and that the proposed semantic model, the first statistical approach to this problem, exhibits significantly better accuracy than the baseline strategy. These results suggest that the new class of designs identified is a promising one. The experiments also serve to highlight the need for a widely applicable theory of data requirements. ',\n",
       " ' Learning Dependencies between Case Frame Slots We address the problem of automatically acquiring case frame patterns (selectional patterns) from large corpus data. In particular, we propose a method of learning dependencies between case frame slots. We view the problem of learning case frame patterns as that of learning multi-dimensional discrete joint distributions, where random variables represent case slots. We then formalize the dependencies between case slots as the probabilistic dependencies between these random variables. Since the number of parameters in a multi-dimensional joint distribution is exponential, it is infeasible to accurately estimate them in practice. To overcome this difficulty, we settle with approximating the target joint distribution by the product of low order component distributions, based on corpus data. In particular we propose to employ an efficient learning algorithm based on the MDL principle to realize this task. Our experimental results indicate that for certain classes of verbs, the accuracy achieved in a disambiguation experiment is improved by using the acquired knowledge of dependencies. ',\n",

Several automatic methods for this task have been proposed in recent years. Yet even the best of these methods can err by several typeset pages. The Smooth Injective Map Recognizer SIMR is a new bitext mapping algorithm. SIMR's errors are smaller than those of the previous front-runner by more than a factor of 4. Its robustness has enabled new commercial-quality applications. The greedy nature of the algorithm makes it independent of memory resources. Unlike other bitext mapping algorithms, SIMR allows crossing correspondences to account for word order differences. Its output can be converted quickly and easily into a sentence alignment. SIMR's output has been used to align over 200 megabytes of the Canadian Hansards for publication by the Linguistic Data Consortium. \",\n",

We define State Oriented Domains, a general category of interaction. Necessary and sufficient conditions for cooperation are outlined. We use the notion of worth in an altered definition of utility, thus enabling agreements in a wider class of joint-goal reachable situations. An approach is offered for conflict resolution, and it is shown that even in a conflict situation, partial cooperative steps can be taken by interacting agents (that is, agents in fundamental conflict might still agree to cooperate up to a certain point). A Unified Negotiation Protocol UNP is developed that can be used in all types of encounters. It is shown that in certain borderline cooperative situations, a partial cooperative agreement (i.e., one that does not achieve all agents' goals) might be preferred by all agents, even though there exists a rational agreement that would achieve all their goals. Finally, we analyze cases where agents have incomplete information on the goals and worth of other agents. First we consider the case where agents' goals are private information, and we analyze what goal declaration strategies the agents might adopt to increase their utility. Then, we consider the situation where the agents' goals (and therefore stand-alone costs) are common knowledge, but the worth they attach to their goals is private information. We introduce two mechanisms, one 'strict', the other 'tolerant', and analyze their affects on the stability and efficiency of negotiation outcomes. \",\n",

In the present paper, I define stochastic attribute-value grammars and give a correct algorithm for estimating their parameters. The estimation algorithm is adapted from Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty (1995). To estimate model parameters, it is necessary to compute the expectations of certain functions under random fields. In the application discussed by Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty (representing English orthographic constraints), Gibbs sampling can be used to estimate the needed expectations. The fact that attribute-value grammars generate constrained languages makes Gibbs sampling inapplicable, but I show how a variant of Gibbs sampling, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, can be used instead.

       " \" A Faster Structured-Tag Word-Classification Method Several methods have been proposed for processing a corpus to induce a tagset for the sub-language represented by the corpus. This paper examines a structured-tag word classification method introduced by McMahon (1994) and discussed further by McMahon & Smith (1995) in cmp-lg/9503011 . Two major variations, (1) non-random initial assignment of words to classes and (2) moving multiple words in parallel, together provide robust non-random results with a speed increase of 200% to 450%, at the cost of slightly lower quality than McMahon's method's average quality. Two further variations, (3) retaining information from less- frequent words and (4) avoiding reclustering closed classes, are proposed for further study. Note: The speed increases quoted above are relative to my implementation of my understanding of McMahon's algorithm; this takes time measured in hours and days on a home PC. A revised version of the McMahon & Smith (1995) paper has appeared (June 1996) in Computational Linguistics 22(2):217- 247; this refers to a time of several weeks to cluster 569 words on a Sparc-IPC. \",\n",

       " ' MUSE CSP: An Extension to the Constraint Satisfaction Problem This paper describes an extension to the constraint satisfaction problem CSP called MUSE CSP (MUltiply SEgmented Constraint Satisfaction Problem). This extension is especially useful for those problems which segment into multiple sets of partially shared variables. Such problems arise naturally in signal processing applications including computer vision, speech processing, and handwriting recognition. For these applications, it is often difficult to segment the data in only one way given the low-level information utilized by the segmentation algorithms. MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent several similar instances of the constraint satisfaction problem. If multiple instances of a CSP have some common variables which have the same domains and constraints, then they can be combined into a single instance of a MUSE CSP, reducing the work required to apply the constraints. We introduce the concepts of MUSE node consistency, MUSE arc consistency, and MUSE path consistency. We then demonstrate how MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent lexically ambiguous sentences and the multiple sentence hypotheses that are often generated by speech recognition algorithms so that grammar constraints can be used to provide parses for all syntactically correct sentences. Algorithms for MUSE arc and path consistency are provided. Finally, we discuss how to create a MUSE CSP from a set of CSPs which are labeled to indicate when the same variable is shared by more than a single CSP. ',\n",
       " \" OT SIMPLE - a construction-kit approach to Optimality Theory implementation This paper details a simple approach to the implementation of Optimality Theory (OT, Prince and Smolensky 1993) on a computer, in part reusing standard system software. In a nutshell, OT's GENerating source is implemented as a BinProlog program interpreting a context-free specification of a GEN structural grammar according to a user-supplied input form. The resulting set of textually flattened candidate tree representations is passed to the CONstraint stage. Constraints are implemented by finite-state transducers specified as `sed' stream editor scripts that typically map ill-formed portions of the candidate to violation marks. EVALuation of candidates reduces to simple sorting: the violation-mark-annotated output leaving CON is fed into `sort', which orders candidates on the basis of the violation vector column of each line, thereby bringing the optimal candidate to the top. This approach gave rise to OT SIMPLE, the first freely available software tool for the OT framework to provide generic facilities for both GEN and CONstraint definition. Its practical applicability is demonstrated by modelling the OT analysis of apparent subtractive pluralization in Upper Hessian presented in Golston and Wiese (1996). \",\n",
       " \" Unsupervised Language Acquisition This thesis presents a computational theory of unsupervised language acquisition, precisely defining procedures for learning language from ordinary spoken or written utterances, with no explicit help from a teacher. The theory is based heavily on concepts borrowed from machine learning and statistical estimation. In particular, learning takes place by fitting a stochastic, generative model of language to the evidence. Much of the thesis is devoted to explaining conditions that must hold for this general learning strategy to arrive at linguistically desirable grammars. The thesis introduces a variety of technical innovations, among them a common representation for evidence and grammars, and a learning strategy that separates the ``content'' of linguistic parameters from their representation. Algorithms based on it suffer from few of the search problems that have plagued other computational approaches to language acquisition. The theory has been tested on problems of learning vocabularies and grammars from unsegmented text and continuous speech, and mappings between sound and representations of meaning. It performs extremely well on various objective criteria, acquiring knowledge that causes it to assign almost exactly the same structure to utterances as humans do. This work has application to data compression, language modeling, speech recognition, machine translation, information retrieval, and other tasks that rely on either structural or stochastic descriptions of language. \",\n",
       " \" Data-Oriented Language Processing. An Overview During the last few years, a new approach to language processing has started to emerge, which has become known under various labels such as data-oriented parsing , corpus-based interpretation , and tree-bank grammar (cf. van den Berg et al. 1994; Bod 1992-96; Bod et al. 1996a/b; Bonnema 1996; Charniak 1996a/b; Goodman 1996; Kaplan 1996; Rajman 1995a/b; Scha 1990-92; Sekine & Grishman 1995; Sima'an et al. 1994; Sima'an 1995-96; Tugwell 1995). This approach, which we will call data-oriented processing or DOP , embodies the assumption that human language perception and production works with representations of concrete past language experiences, rather than with abstract linguistic rules. The models that instantiate this approach therefore maintain large corpora of linguistic representations of previously occurring utterances. When processing a new input utterance, analyses of this utterance are constructed by combining fragments from the corpus; the occurrence-frequencies of the fragments are used to estimate which analysis is the most probable one. In this paper we give an in-depth discussion of a data-oriented processing model which employs a corpus of labelled phrase-structure trees. Then we review some other models that instantiate the DOP approach. Many of these models also employ labelled phrase-structure trees, but use different criteria for extracting fragments from the corpus or employ different disambiguation strategies (Bod 1996b; Charniak 1996a/b; Goodman 1996; Rajman 1995a/b; Sekine & Grishman 1995; Sima'an 1995-96); other models use richer formalisms for their corpus annotations (van den Berg et al. 1994; Bod et al., 1996a/b; Bonnema 1996; Kaplan 1996; Tugwell 1995). \",\n",
       " ' Nonuniform Markov models A statistical language model assigns probability to strings of arbitrary length. Unfortunately, it is not possible to gather reliable statistics on strings of arbitrary length from a finite corpus. Therefore, a statistical language model must decide that each symbol in a string depends on at most a small, finite number of other symbols in the string. In this report we propose a new way to model conditional independence in Markov models. The central feature of our nonuniform Markov model is that it makes predictions of varying lengths using contexts of varying lengths. Experiments on the Wall Street Journal reveal that the nonuniform model performs slightly better than the classic interpolated Markov model. This result is somewhat remarkable because both models contain identical numbers of parameters whose values are estimated in a similar manner. The only difference between the two models is how they combine the statistics of longer and shorter strings. Keywords: nonuniform Markov model, interpolated Markov model, conditional independence, statistical language model, discrete time series. ',\n",

       " ' A Framework for Natural Language Interfaces to Temporal Databases Over the past thirty years, there has been considerable progress in the design of natural language interfaces to databases. Most of this work has concerned snapshot databases, in which there are only limited facilities for manipulating time-varying information. The database community is becoming increasingly interested in temporal databases, databases with special support for time-dependent entries. We have developed a framework for constructing natural language interfaces to temporal databases, drawing on research on temporal phenomena within logic and linguistics. The central part of our framework is a logic-like formal language, called TOP, which can capture the semantics of a wide range of English sentences. We have implemented an HPSG-based sentence analyser that converts a large set of English queries involving time into TOP formulae, and have formulated a provably correct procedure for translating TOP expressions into queries in the TSQL2 temporal database language. In this way we have established a sound route from English to a general-purpose temporal database language. ',\n",

We also briefly discuss a potential application of our results to the problem of learning graphical models from data. ',\n",
       " \" Exploiting Causal Independence in Bayesian Network Inference A new method is proposed for exploiting causal independencies in exact Bayesian network inference. A Bayesian network can be viewed as representing a factorization of a joint probability into the multiplication of a set of conditional probabilities. We present a notion of causal independence that enables one to further factorize the conditional probabilities into a combination of even smaller factors and consequently obtain a finer-grain factorization of the joint probability. The new formulation of causal independence lets us specify the conditional probability of a variable given its parents in terms of an associative and commutative operator, such as ``or'', ``sum'' or ``max'', on the contribution of each parent. We start with a simple algorithm VE for Bayesian network inference that, given evidence and a query variable, uses the factorization to find the posterior distribution of the query. We show how this algorithm can be extended to exploit causal independence. Empirical studies, based on the CPCS networks for medical diagnosis, show that this method is more efficient than previous methods and allows for inference in larger networks than previous algorithms. \",\n",

       " ' Specialized Language Models using Dialogue Predictions This paper analyses language modeling in spoken dialogue systems for accessing a database. The use of several language models obtained by exploiting dialogue predictions gives better results than the use of a single model for the whole dialogue interaction. For this reason several models have been created, each one for a specific system question, such as the request or the confirmation of a parameter. The use of dialogue-dependent language models increases the performance both at the recognition and at the understanding level, especially on answers to system requests. Moreover other methods to increase performance, like automatic clustering of vocabulary words or the use of better acoustic models during recognition, does not affect the improvements given by dialogue-dependent language models. The system used in our experiments is Dialogos, the Italian spoken dialogue system used for accessing railway timetable information over the telephone. The experiments were carried out on a large corpus of dialogues collected using Dialogos. ',\n",

The set of metrics we propose offers useful insights in evaluating how particular choices in the dialogue management can affect the overall quality of the man-machine dialogue. The evaluation makes use of established metrics: the transaction success, the contextual appropriateness of system answers, the calculation of normal and correction turns in a dialogue. We also define a new metric, the implicit recovery, which allows to measure the ability of a dialogue manager to deal with errors by different levels of analysis. We report evaluation data from several experiments, and we compare two different approaches to dialogue repair strategies using the set of metrics we argue for. ',\n",

The robust behavior of the system has been achieved by combining the use of specific language models during the recognition phase of analysis, the tolerance toward spontaneous speech phenomena, the activity of a robust parser, and the use of pragmatic-based dialogue knowledge. This integration of the different modules allows to deal with partial or total breakdowns of the different levels of analysis. We report the field trial data of the system and the evaluation results of the overall system and of the submodules. ',\n",

The Value Difference Metric VDM was designed to find reasonable distance values between nominal attribute values, but it largely ignores continuous attributes, requiring discretization to map continuous values into nominal values. This paper proposes three new heterogeneous distance functions, called the Heterogeneous Value Difference Metric HVDM, the Interpolated Value Difference Metric IVDM, and the Windowed Value Difference Metric WVDM. These new distance functions are designed to handle applications with nominal attributes, continuous attributes, or both.

The maximum entropy framework provides a constructive method for obtaining the unique conditional distribution p*(y|x) that satisfies a set of linear constraints and maximizes the conditional entropy H(p|f) with respect to the empirical distribution f(x). The maximum entropy distribution p*(y|x) also has a unique parametric representation in the class of exponential models, as m(y|x) = r(y|x)/Z(x) where the numerator m(y|x) = prod_i alpha_i^g_i(x,y) is a product of exponential weights, with alpha_i = exp(lambda_i), and the denominator Z(x) = sum_y r(y|x) is required to satisfy the axioms of probability. This manual explains how to build maximum entropy models for discrete domains with the Maximum Entropy Modeling Toolkit MEMT. First we summarize the steps necessary to implement a language model using the toolkit. Next we discuss the executables provided by the toolkit and explain the file formats required by the toolkit. Finally, we review the maximum entropy framework and apply it to the problem of statistical language modeling.

       " \" SCREEN: Learning a Flat Syntactic and Semantic Spoken Language Analysis Using Artificial Neural Networks Previous approaches of analyzing spontaneously spoken language often have been based on encoding syntactic and semantic knowledge manually and symbolically. While there has been some progress using statistical or connectionist language models, many current spoken- language systems still use a relatively brittle, hand-coded symbolic grammar or symbolic semantic component. In contrast, we describe a so-called screening approach for learning robust processing of spontaneously spoken language. A screening approach is a flat analysis which uses shallow sequences of category representations for analyzing an utterance at various syntactic, semantic and dialog levels. Rather than using a deeply structured symbolic analysis, we use a flat connectionist analysis. This screening approach aims at supporting speech and language processing by using (1) data-driven learning and (2) robustness of connectionist networks. In order to test this approach, we have developed the SCREEN system which is based on this new robust, learned and flat analysis. In this paper, we focus on a detailed description of SCREEN's architecture, the flat syntactic and semantic analysis, the interaction with a speech recognizer, and a detailed evaluation analysis of the robustness under the influence of noisy or incomplete input. The main result of this paper is that flat representations allow more robust processing of spontaneous spoken language than deeply structured representations. In particular, we show how the fault-tolerance and learning capability of connectionist networks can support a flat analysis for providing more robust spoken-language processing within an overall hybrid symbolic/connectionist framework. \",\n",

Most words in natural language are ambiguous and their meanings are heavily dependent on the linguistic context in which they are used. The study of lexical semantics can not be separated from the notion of context. This paper takes a contextual approach to lexical semantics and studies the linguistic context of lexical atoms, or sticky phrases such as hot dog . Since such lexical atoms may occur frequently in unrestricted natural language text, recognizing them is crucial for understanding naturally-occurring text. The paper proposes several heuristic approaches to exploiting the linguistic context to identify lexical atoms from arbitrary natural language text. ',\n",
       " \" Hybrid language processing in the Spoken Language Translator The paper presents an overview of the Spoken Language Translator SLT system's hybrid language-processing architecture, focussing on the way in which rule-based and statistical methods are combined to achieve robust and efficient performance within a linguistically motivated framework. In general, we argue that rules are desirable in order to encode domain-independent linguistic constraints and achieve high-quality grammatical output, while corpus-derived statistics are needed if systems are to be efficient and robust; further, that hybrid architectures are superior from the point of view of portability to architectures which only make use of one type of information. We address the topics of ``multi-engine'' strategies for robust translation; robust bottom-up parsing using pruning and grammar specialization; rational development of linguistic rule-sets using balanced domain corpora; and efficient supervised training by interactive disambiguation. All work described is fully implemented in the current version of the SLT-2 system. \",\n",
       " \" Generating Information-Sharing Subdialogues in Expert-User Consultation In expert-consultation dialogues, it is inevitable that an agent will at times have insufficient information to determine whether to accept or reject a proposal by the other agent. This results in the need for the agent to initiate an information-sharing subdialogue to form a set of shared beliefs within which the agents can effectively re-evaluate the proposal. This paper presents a computational strategy for initiating such information-sharing subdialogues to resolve the system's uncertainty regarding the acceptance of a user proposal. Our model determines when information-sharing should be pursued, selects a focus of information-sharing among multiple uncertain beliefs, chooses the most effective information-sharing strategy, and utilizes the newly obtained information to re-evaluate the user proposal. Furthermore, our model is capable of handling embedded information-sharing subdialogues. \",\n",
       " \" An Efficient Implementation of the Head-Corner Parser This paper describes an efficient and robust implementation of a bi-directional, head-driven parser for constraint-based grammars. This parser is developed for the OVIS system: a Dutch spoken dialogue system in which information about public transport can be obtained by telephone. After a review of the motivation for head-driven parsing strategies, and head-corner parsing in particular, a non-deterministic version of the head-corner parser is presented. A memoization technique is applied to obtain a fast parser. A goal-weakening technique is introduced which greatly improves average case efficiency, both in terms of speed and space requirements. I argue in favor of such a memoization strategy with goal-weakening in comparison with ordinary chart-parsers because such a strategy can be applied selectively and therefore enormously reduces the space requirements of the parser, while no practical loss in time-efficiency is observed. On the contrary, experiments are described in which head-corner and left-corner parsers implemented with selective memoization and goal weakening outperform `standard' chart parsers. The experiments include the grammar of the OVIS system and the Alvey NL Tools grammar. Head-corner parsing is a mix of bottom-up and top-down processing. Certain approaches towards robust parsing require purely bottom-up processing. Therefore, it seems that head-corner parsing is unsuitable for such robust parsing techniques. However, it is shown how underspecification (which arises very naturally in a logic programming environment) can be used in the head-corner parser to allow such robust parsing techniques. A particular robust parsing model is described which is implemented in OVIS. \",\n",

       " ' A Robust Text Processing Technique Applied to Lexical Error Recovery This thesis addresses automatic lexical error recovery and tokenization of corrupt text input. We propose a technique that can automatically correct misspellings, segmentation errors and real-word errors in a unified framework that uses both a model of language production and a model of the typing behavior, and which makes tokenization part of the recovery process. The typing process is modeled as a noisy channel where Hidden Markov Models are used to model the channel characteristics. Weak statistical language models are used to predict what sentences are likely to be transmitted through the channel. These components are held together in the Token Passing framework which provides the desired tight coupling between orthographic pattern matching and linguistic expectation. The system, CTR (Connected Text Recognition), has been tested on two corpora derived from two different applications, a natural language dialogue system and a transcription typing scenario. Experiments show that CTR can automatically correct a considerable portion of the errors in the test sets without introducing too much noise. The segmentation error correction rate is virtually faultless. ',\n",

While much effort has been made to apply NLP techniques to IR, very few NLP techniques have been evaluated on a document collection larger than several megabytes. Many NLP techniques are simply not efficient enough, and not robust enough, to handle a large amount of text.

It is evident that this has so far been primarily research within a new field, computational linguistics, which is largely motivated by the demands, and interest, of practical processing systems, and that information technology has had rather little influence on linguistics at large.

We present a prototype system called PROFILE which uses a client-server architecture to extract noun-phrase descriptions of entities such as people, places, and organizations. The system serves two purposes: as an information extraction tool, it allows users to search for textual descriptions of entities; as a utility to generate functional descriptions FD, it is used in a functional-unification based generation system. We present an evaluation of the approach and its applications to natural language generation and summarization. ',\n",

We argue that linguistic style is a key aspect of character, and show how speech act representations common in AI can provide abstract representations from which computer characters can improvise. We show that the mechanisms proposed introduce the possibility of socially oriented agents, meet the requirements that lifelike characters be believable, and satisfy particular criteria for improvisation proposed by Hayes-Roth.

This document consists of instructions for annotating the temporal information in scheduling dialogs, dialogs in which the participants schedule a meeting with one another.

       " ' A Uniform Framework for Concept Definitions in Description Logics Most modern formalisms used in Databases and Artificial Intelligence for describing an application domain are based on the notions of class (or concept) and relationship among classes. One interesting feature of such formalisms is the possibility of defining a class, i.e., providing a set of properties that precisely characterize the instances of the class. Many recent articles point out that there are several ways of assigning a meaning to a class definition containing some sort of recursion. In this paper, we argue that, instead of choosing a single style of semantics, we achieve better results by adopting a formalism that allows for different semantics to coexist. We demonstrate the feasibility of our argument, by presenting a knowledge representation formalism, the description logic muALCQ, with the above characteristics. In addition to the constructs for conjunction, disjunction, negation, quantifiers, and qualified number restrictions, muALCQ includes special fixpoint constructs to express (suitably interpreted) recursive definitions. These constructs enable the usual frame-based descriptions to be combined with definitions of recursive data structures such as directed acyclic graphs, lists, streams, etc. We establish several properties of muALCQ, including the decidability and the computational complexity of reasoning, by formulating a correspondence with a particular modal logic of programs called the modal mu-calculus.

It is based on a previously developed clustering algorithm, but with a modified optimisation criterion. The results are shown to be slightly superior to the previously published 'Fillup' method, which can be used to adapt standard n-gram models. However, the improvement both methods give compared to models built from scratch on the adaptation data is quite small (less than 11% relative improvement in word error rate). This suggests that both methods are still unsatisfactory from a practical point of view. \",\n",

       " ' A Potts Neuron Approach to Communication Routing A feedback neural network approach to communication routing problems is developed with emphasis on Multiple Shortest Path problems, with several requests for transmissions between distinct start- and endnodes. The basic ingredients are a set of Potts neurons for each request, with interactions designed to minimize path lengths and to prevent overloading of network arcs. The topological nature of the problem is conveniently handled using a propagator matrix approach. Although the constraints are global, the algorithmic steps are based entirely on local information, facilitating distributed implementations. In the polynomially solvable single-request case the approach reduces to a fuzzy version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. The approach is evaluated for synthetic problems of varying sizes and load levels, by comparing with exact solutions from a branch-and-bound method. With very few exceptions, the Potts approach gives legal solutions of very high quality. The computational demand scales merely as the product of the numbers of requests, nodes, and arcs. ',\n",

The set of techniques have been applied in a combined way to disambiguate the genus terms of two machine-readable dictionaries MRD, enabling us to construct complete taxonomies for Spanish and French.

Our results for disambiguating Turkish indicate that using about 500 constraint rules and some additional simple statistics, we can attain a recall of 95-96% and a precision of 94-95% with about 1.01 parses per token.

       " \" Insecurity of Quantum Secure Computations It had been widely claimed that quantum mechanics can protect private information during public decision in for example the so-called two-party secure computation. If this were the case, quantum smart-cards could prevent fake teller machines from learning the PIN (Personal Identification Number) from the customers' input. Although such optimism has been challenged by the recent surprising discovery of the insecurity of the so-called quantum bit commitment, the security of quantum two-party computation itself remains unaddressed. Here I answer this question directly by showing that all ``one-sided'' two-party computations (which allow only one of the two parties to learn the result) are necessarily insecure. As corollaries to my results, quantum one-way oblivious password identification and the so-called quantum one-out-of-two oblivious transfer are impossible. I also construct a class of functions that cannot be computed securely in any ``two-sided'' two-party computation. Nevertheless, quantum cryptography remains useful in key distribution and can still provide partial security in ``quantum money'' proposed by Wiesner. \",\n",

       " \" Connectionist Theory Refinement: Genetically Searching the Space of Network Topologies An algorithm that learns from a set of examples should ideally be able to exploit the available resources of (a) abundant computing power and (b) domain-specific knowledge to improve its ability to generalize. Connectionist theory-refinement systems, which use background knowledge to select a neural network's topology and initial weights, have proven to be effective at exploiting domain-specific knowledge; however, most do not exploit available computing power. This weakness occurs because they lack the ability to refine the topology of the neural networks they produce, thereby limiting generalization, especially when given impoverished domain theories. We present the REGENT algorithm which uses (a) domain-specific knowledge to help create an initial population of knowledge-based neural networks and (b) genetic operators of crossover and mutation (specifically designed for knowledge-based networks) to continually search for better network topologies. Experiments on three real-world domains indicate that our new algorithm is able to significantly increase generalization compared to a standard connectionist theory-refinement system, as well as our previous algorithm for growing knowledge-based networks. \",\n",
       " ' Query DAGs: A Practical Paradigm for Implementing Belief-Network Inference We describe a new paradigm for implementing inference in belief networks, which consists of two steps: (1) compiling a belief network into an arithmetic expression called a Query DAG (Q-DAG); and (2) answering queries using a simple evaluation algorithm. Each node of a Q-DAG represents a numeric operation, a number, or a symbol for evidence. Each leaf node of a Q-DAG represents the answer to a network query, that is, the probability of some event of interest. It appears that Q-DAGs can be generated using any of the standard algorithms for exact inference in belief networks (we show how they can be generated using clustering and conditioning algorithms). The time and space complexity of a Q-DAG generation algorithm is no worse than the time complexity of the inference algorithm on which it is based. The complexity of a Q-DAG evaluation algorithm is linear in the size of the Q-DAG, and such inference amounts to a standard evaluation of the arithmetic expression it represents. The intended value of Q-DAGs is in reducing the software and hardware resources required to utilize belief networks in on-line, real-world applications. The proposed framework also facilitates the development of on-line inference on different software and hardware platforms due to the simplicity of the Q-DAG evaluation algorithm. Interestingly enough, Q-DAGs were found to serve other purposes: simple techniques for reducing Q-DAGs tend to subsume relatively complex optimization techniques for belief-network inference, such as network-pruning and computation-caching.

It is further shown to capture the interaction of sloppy/strict ambiguity with quantification and binding. ',\n",
       " ' Document Classification Using a Finite Mixture Model We propose a new method of classifying documents into categories. The simple method of conducting hypothesis testing over word-based distributions in categories suffers from the data sparseness problem. In order to address this difficulty, Guthrie et.al. have developed a method using distributions based on hard clustering of words, i.e., in which a word is assigned to a single cluster and words in the same cluster are treated uniformly. This method might, however, degrade classification results, since the distributions it employs are not always precise enough for representing the differences between categories. We propose here the use of soft clustering of words, i.e., in which a word can be assigned to several different clusters and each cluster is characterized by a specific word probability distribution. We define for each document category a finite mixture model, which is a linear combination of the probability distributions of the clusters. We thereby treat the problem of classifying documents as that of conducting statistical hypothesis testing over finite mixture models. In order to accomplish this testing, we employ the EM algorithm which helps efficiently estimate parameters in a finite mixture model. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms not only the method using distributions based on hard clustering, but also the method using word-based distributions and the method based on cosine-similarity.

       " ' Quantitative Constraint Logic Programming for Weighted Grammar Applications Constraint logic grammars provide a powerful formalism for expressing complex logical descriptions of natural language phenomena in exact terms. Describing some of these phenomena may, however, require some form of graded distinctions which are not provided by such grammars. Recent approaches to weighted constraint logic grammars attempt to address this issue by adding numerical calculation schemata to the deduction scheme of the underlying CLP framework. Currently, these extralogical extensions are not related to the model-theoretic counterpart of the operational semantics of CLP, i.e., they do not come with a formal semantics at all. The aim of this paper is to present a clear formal semantics for weighted constraint logic grammars, which abstracts away from specific interpretations of weights, but nevertheless gives insights into the parsing problem for such weighted grammars. Building on the formalization of constraint logic grammars in the CLP scheme of Hoehfeld and Smolka 1988, this formal semantics will be given by a quantitative version of CLP. Such a quantitative CLP scheme can also be valuable for CLP tasks independent of grammars. ',\n",

       " \" Charts, Interaction-Free Grammars, and the Compact Representation of Ambiguity Recently researchers working in the LFG framework have proposed algorithms for taking advantage of the implicit context-free components of a unification grammar [Maxwell 96]. This paper clarifies the mathematical foundations of these techniques, provides a uniform framework in which they can be formally studied and eliminates the need for special purpose runtime data-structures recording ambiguity. The paper posits the identity: Ambiguous Feature Structures = Grammars, which states that (finitely) ambiguous representations are best seen as unification grammars of a certain type, here called ``interaction-free'' grammars, which generate in a backtrack-free way each of the feature structures subsumed by the ambiguous representation. This work extends a line of research [Billot and Lang 89, Lang 94] which stresses the connection between charts and grammars: a chart can be seen as a specialization of the reference grammar for a given input string. We show how this specialization grammar can be transformed into an interaction-free form which has the same practicality as a listing of the individual solutions, but is produced in less time and space. \",\n",

This leads to a new type of semantic lexicon (CoreLex) that supports underspecified semantic tagging through a design based on systematic polysemous classes and a class-based acquisition of lexical knowledge for specific domains.

       " ' Choiceless polynomial time Turing machines define polynomial time (PTime) on strings but cannot deal with structures like graphs directly, and there is no known, easily computable string encoding of isomorphism classes of structures. Is there a computation model whose machines do not distinguish between isomorphic structures and compute exactly PTime properties? This question can be recast as follows: Does there exist a logic that captures polynomial time (without presuming the presence of a linear order)? Earlier, one of us conjectured the negative answer. The problem motivated a quest for stronger and stronger PTime logics. All these logics avoid arbitrary choice. Here we attempt to capture the choiceless fragment of PTime. Our computation model is a version of abstract state machines (formerly called evolving algebras). The idea is to replace arbitrary choice with parallel execution. The resulting logic is more expressive than other PTime logics in the literature. A more difficult theorem shows that the logic does not capture all PTime. ',\n",

It works essentially as a cascaded, nondeterministic finite-state automaton. There are five stages in the operation of FASTUS. In Stage 1, names and other fixed form expressions are recognized. In Stage 2, basic noun groups, verb groups, and prepositions and some other particles are recognized. In Stage 3, certain complex noun groups and verb groups are constructed. Patterns for events of interest are identified in Stage 4 and corresponding ``event structures'' are built. In Stage 5, distinct event structures that describe the same event are identified and merged, and these are used in generating database entries. This decomposition of language processing enables the system to do exactly the right amount of domain-independent syntax, so that domain-dependent semantic and pragmatic processing can be applied to the right larger-scale structures. FASTUS is very efficient and effective, and has been used successfully in a number of applications. \",\n",

We review this literature, and present new experimental results that generalize the earlier work and explain some of the discrepancies in it. In particular, we describe the Least-Cost Flaw Repair LCFR strategy developed and analyzed by Joslin and Pollack (1994), and compare it with other strategies, including Gerevini and Schubert's (1996) ZLIFO strategy. LCFR and ZLIFO make very different, and apparently conflicting claims about the most effective way to reduce search-space size in POCL planning. We resolve this conflict, arguing that much of the benefit that Gerevini and Schubert ascribe to the LIFO component of their ZLIFO strategy is better attributed to other causes. We show that for many problems, a strategy that combines least-cost flaw selection with the delay of separable threats will be effective in reducing search-space size, and will do so without excessive computational overhead. Although such a strategy thus provides a good default, we also show that certain domain characteristics may reduce its effectiveness. \",\n",

Eisner (1996) trained three probability models on a small set of about 4,000 conjunction-free, dependency-grammar parses derived from the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank, and then evaluated the models on a held-out test set, using a novel O(n^3) parsing algorithm. The present paper describes some details of the experiments and repeats them with a larger training set of 25,000 sentences. As reported at the talk, the more extensive training yields greatly improved performance. Nearly half the sentences are parsed with no misattachments; two-thirds are parsed with at most one misattachment. Of the models described in the original written paper, the best score is still obtained with the generative (top-down) model C. However, slightly better models are also explored, in particular, two variants on the comprehension (bottom-up) model B. The better of these has an attachment accuracy of 90%, and (unlike model C) tags words more accurately than the comparable trigram tagger. Differences are statistically significant. If tags are roughly known in advance, search error is all but eliminated and the new model attains an attachment accuracy of 93%. We find that the parser of Collins (1996), when combined with a highly-trained tagger, also achieves 93% when trained and tested on the same sentences. Similarities and differences are discussed.

We propose (a) a lexical affinity model where words struggle to modify each other, (b) a sense tagging model where words fluctuate randomly in their selectional preferences, and (c) a generative model where the speaker fleshes out each word's syntactic and conceptual structure without regard to the implications for the hearer. We also give preliminary empirical results from evaluating the three models' parsing performance on annotated Wall Street Journal training text (derived from the Penn Treebank). In these results, the generative (i.e., top-down) model performs significantly better than the others, and does about equally well at assigning part-of-speech tags. \",\n",
       " ' Aggregate and mixed-order Markov models for statistical language processing We consider the use of language models whose size and accuracy are intermediate between different order n-gram models. Two types of models are studied in particular. Aggregate Markov models are class-based bigram models in which the mapping from words to classes is probabilistic. Mixed-order Markov models combine bigram models whose predictions are conditioned on different words. Both types of models are trained by Expectation-Maximization EM algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation. We examine smoothing procedures in which these models are interposed between different order n-grams. This is found to significantly reduce the perplexity of unseen word combinations. ',\n",

The methods described in this paper, McQuitty's similarity analysis, Ward's minimum-variance method, and the EM algorithm, assign each instance of an ambiguous word to a known sense definition based solely on the values of automatically identifiable features in text. These methods and feature sets are found to be more successful in disambiguating nouns rather than adjectives or verbs. Overall, the most accurate of these procedures is McQuitty's similarity analysis in combination with a high dimensional feature set. \",\n",
       " ' Library of Practical Abstractions, Release 1.2 The library of practical abstractions LIBPA provides efficient implementations of conceptually simple abstractions, in the C programming language. We believe that the best library code is conceptually simple so that it will be easily understood by the application programmer; parameterized by type so that it enjoys wide applicability; and at least as efficient as a straightforward special-purpose implementation. You will find that our software satisfies the highest standards of software design, implementation, testing, and benchmarking. The current LIBPA release is a source code distribution only. It consists of modules for portable memory management, one dimensional arrays of arbitrary types, compact symbol tables, hash tables for arbitrary types, a trie module for length-delimited strings over arbitrary alphabets, single precision floating point numbers with extended exponents, and logarithmic representations of probability values using either fixed or floating point numbers. We have used LIBPA to implement a wide range of statistical models for both continuous and discrete domains. The time and space efficiency of LIBPA has allowed us to build larger statistical models than previously reported, and to investigate more computationally-intensive techniques than previously possible. We have found LIBPA to be indispensible in our own research, and hope that you will find it useful in yours. ',\n",
       " \" Mistake-Driven Learning in Text Categorization Learning problems in the text processing domain often map the text to a space whose dimensions are the measured features of the text, e.g., its words. Three characteristic properties of this domain are (a) very high dimensionality, (b) both the learned concepts and the instances reside very sparsely in the feature space, and (c) a high variation in the number of active features in an instance. In this work we study three mistake-driven learning algorithms for a typical task of this nature -- text categorization. We argue that these algorithms -- which categorize documents by learning a linear separator in the feature space -- have a few properties that make them ideal for this domain. We then show that a quantum leap in performance is achieved when we further modify the algorithms to better address some of the specific characteristics of the domain. In particular, we demonstrate (1) how variation in document length can be tolerated by either normalizing feature weights or by using negative weights, (2) the positive effect of applying a threshold range in training, (3) alternatives in considering feature frequency, and (4) the benefits of discarding features while training. Overall, we present an algorithm, a variation of Littlestone's Winnow, which performs significantly better than any other algorithm tested on this task using a similar feature set. \",\n",
       " ' A Corpus-Based Approach for Building Semantic Lexicons Semantic knowledge can be a great asset to natural language processing systems, but it is usually hand-coded for each application. Although some semantic information is available in general-purpose knowledge bases such as WordNet and Cyc, many applications require domain-specific lexicons that represent words and categories for a particular topic. In this paper, we present a corpus-based method that can be used to build semantic lexicons for specific categories. The input to the system is a small set of seed words for a category and a representative text corpus. The output is a ranked list of words that are associated with the category. A user then reviews the top-ranked words and decides which ones should be entered in the semantic lexicon. In experiments with five categories, users typically found about 60 words per category in 10-15 minutes to build a core semantic lexicon. ',\n",

In preparing the corpora, it is important to evaluate the reliability of the annotation, but methods for doing so have not been readily available. In this report, I present a method for computing reliability of coreference annotation. First I review a method for applying the information retrieval metrics of recall and precision to coreference annotation proposed by Marc Vilain and his collaborators. I show how this method makes it possible to construct contingency tables for computing Cohen's Kappa, a familiar reliability metric. By comparing recall and precision to reliability on the same data sets, I also show that recall and precision can be misleadingly high. Because Kappa factors out chance agreement among coders, it is a preferable measure for developing annotated corpora where no pre-existing target annotation exists. \",\n",

The parser itself requires very little human intervention, since the information it uses to make parsing decisions is specified in a concise and simple manner, and is combined in a fully automatic way under the maximum entropy framework. The observed running time of the parser on a test sentence is linear with respect to the sentence length. Furthermore, the parser returns several scored parses for a sentence, and this paper shows that a scheme to pick the best parse from the 20 highest scoring parses could yield a dramatically higher accuracy of 93% precision and recall.

The procedure takes as input a grammar and a set of feature paths indicating the position of semantic indices in a sign, and calculates the fixed-point of a set of equations derived from the grammar. The result is a set of independent constraints stating which indices in a sign can be bound to other signs within a complete sentence. Based on these constraints, two tests are formulated which reduce the search space during generation. ',\n",

Our approach enlists both short-range and long-range language models to help it sniff out likely sites of topic changes in text. To aid its search, the system consults a set of simple lexical hints it has learned to associate with the presence of boundaries through inspection of a large corpus of annotated data. We also propose a new probabilistically motivated error metric for use by the natural language processing and information retrieval communities, intended to supersede precision and recall for appraising segmentation algorithms. Qualitative assessment of our algorithm as well as evaluation using this new metric demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in two very different domains, Wall Street Journal articles and the TDT Corpus, a collection of newswire articles and broadcast news transcripts.

       " \" A Model of Lexical Attraction and Repulsion This paper introduces new methods based on exponential families for modeling the correlations between words in text and speech. While previous work assumed the effects of word co-occurrence statistics to be constant over a window of several hundred words, we show that their influence is nonstationary on a much smaller time scale. Empirical data drawn from English and Japanese text, as well as conversational speech, reveals that the ``attraction'' between words decays exponentially, while stylistic and syntactic contraints create a ``repulsion'' between words that discourages close co-occurrence. We show that these characteristics are well described by simple mixture models based on two-stage exponential distributions which can be trained using the EM algorithm. The resulting distance distributions can then be incorporated as penalizing features in an exponential language model. \",\n",

In this paper we present an alternative approach where the labor is distributed between a more restrictive partial parser and a repair module. Though two stage approaches have grown in popularity in recent years because of their efficiency, they have done so at the cost of requiring hand coded repair heuristics. In contrast, our two stage approach does not require any hand coded knowledge sources dedicated to repair, thus making it possible to achieve a similar run time advantage over MDP without losing the quality of domain independence.

SIMR is faster and significantly more accurate than other algorithms in the literature.

       " \" Automatic Discovery of Non-Compositional Compounds in Parallel Data Automatic segmentation of text into minimal content-bearing units is an unsolved problem even for languages like English. Spaces between words offer an easy first approximation, but this approximation is not good enough for machine translation MT, where many word sequences are not translated word-for-word. This paper presents an efficient automatic method for discovering sequences of words that are translated as a unit. The method proceeds by comparing pairs of statistical translation models induced from parallel texts in two languages. It can discover hundreds of non-compositional compounds on each iteration, and constructs longer compounds out of shorter ones. Objective evaluation on a simple machine translation task has shown the method's potential to improve the quality of MT output. The method makes few assumptions about the data, so it can be applied to parallel data other than parallel texts, such as word spellings and pronunciations. \",\n",
       " \" A Word-to-Word Model of Translational Equivalence Many multilingual NLP applications need to translate words between different languages, but cannot afford the computational expense of inducing or applying a full translation model. For these applications, we have designed a fast algorithm for estimating a partial translation model, which accounts for translational equivalence only at the word level. The model's precision/recall trade-off can be directly controlled via one threshold parameter. This feature makes the model more suitable for applications that are not fully statistical. The model's hidden parameters can be easily conditioned on information extrinsic to the model, providing an easy way to integrate pre-existing knowledge such as part-of-speech, dictionaries, word order, etc.. Our model can link word tokens in parallel texts as well as other translation models in the literature. Unlike other translation models, it can automatically produce dictionary-sized translation lexicons, and it can do so with over 99% accuracy. \",\n",

The solutions to constraints expressed in weak monadic second order MSO logic are represented by tree automata recognizing the assignments which make the formulas true. We show that this allows an efficient representation of knowledge about the content of constraints which can be used as a practical tool for grammatical theory verification. We achieve this by using the intertranslatability of formulas of MSO logic and tree automata and the embedding of MSO logic into a constraint logic programming scheme. The usefulness of the approach is discussed with examples from the realm of Principles-and-Parameters based parsing. ',\n",

       " ' A New Look at the Easy-Hard-Easy Pattern of Combinatorial Search Difficulty The easy-hard-easy pattern in the difficulty of combinatorial search problems as constraints are added has been explained as due to a competition between the decrease in number of solutions and increased pruning. We test the generality of this explanation by examining one of its predictions: if the number of solutions is held fixed by the choice of problems, then increased pruning should lead to a monotonic decrease in search cost. Instead, we find the easy-hard-easy pattern in median search cost even when the number of solutions is held constant, for some search methods. This generalizes previous observations of this pattern and shows that the existing theory does not explain the full range of the peak in search cost. In these cases the pattern appears to be due to changes in the size of the minimal unsolvable subproblems, rather than changing numbers of solutions. ',\n",

Complications arise when examining partial orders that are not present for total orders. There are subtleties involving the exact approach to lifting the order on worlds to an order on sets of worlds. In addition, the axiomatization of the logic of relative likelihood in the case of partial orders gives insight into the connection between relative likelihood and default reasoning. ',\n",

As our parsing model we choose a deterministic shift-reduce type parser that integrates part-of-speech tagging and syntactic and semantic processing. Applying machine learning techniques, the system uses parse action examples acquired under supervision to generate a parser in the form of a decision structure, a generalization of decision trees. To learn good parsing and translation decisions, our system relies heavily on context, as encoded in currently 205 features describing the morphological, syntactical and semantical aspects of a given parse state. Compared with recent probabilistic systems that were trained on 40,000 sentences, our system relies on more background knowledge and a deeper analysis, but radically fewer examples, currently 256 sentences. We test our parser on lexically limited sentences from the Wall Street Journal and achieve accuracy rates of 89.8% for labeled precision, 98.4% for part of speech tagging and 56.3% of test sentences without any crossing brackets. Machine translations of 32 Wall Street Journal sentences to German have been evaluated by 10 bilingual volunteers and been graded as 2.4 on a 1.0 (best) to 6.0 (worst) scale for both grammatical correctness and meaning preservation.

This problem is analogous to a mathematical optimisation problem: the textual constraints can be described as a set of constraint equations, and the requirement for minimal change to the text can be expressed as a function to be minimised; so techniques from this domain can be used to solve the problem. The work is done as part of a computational paraphrase system using the XTAG system as a base.

The central notion in this account is that of a higher-order substitution. Whereas in traditional presentations of rule systems for abstract language families the emphasis has been on a first-order substitution process in which auxiliary variables are replaced by elements of the carrier of the proper algebra - concatenations of terminal and auxiliary category symbols in the string case - we lift this process to the level of operations defined on the elements of the carrier of the algebra. Our own view is that this change of emphasis provides the adequate platform for a better understanding of the operation of adjunction. To put it in a nutshell: Adjoining is not a first-order, but a second-order substitution operation. ',\n",
       " \" A lexical database tool for quantitative phonological research A lexical database tool tailored for phonological research is described. Database fields include transcriptions, glosses and hyperlinks to speech files. Database queries are expressed using HTML forms, and these permit regular expression search on any combination of fields. Regular expressions are passed directly to a Perl CGI program, enabling the full flexibility of Perl extended regular expressions. The regular expression notation is extended to better support phonological searches, such as search for minimal pairs. Search results are presented in the form of HTML or LaTeX tables, where each cell is either a number (representing frequency) or a designated subset of the fields. Tables have up to four dimensions, with an elegant system for specifying which fragments of which fields should be used for the row/column labels. The tool offers several advantages over traditional methods of analysis: (i) it supports a quantitative method of doing phonological research; (ii) it gives universal access to the same set of informants; (iii) it enables other researchers to hear the original speech data without having to rely on published transcriptions; (iv) it makes the full power of regular expression search available, and search results are full multimedia documents; and (v) it enables the early refutation of false hypotheses, shortening the analysis-hypothesis-test loop. A life-size application to an African tone language (Dschang) is used for exemplification throughout the paper. The database contains 2200 records, each with approximately 15 fields.

       " \" On Cloning Context-Freeness To Rogers (1994) we owe the insight that monadic second order predicate logic with multiple successors MSO is well suited in many respects as a realistic formal base for syntactic theorizing. However, the agreeable formal properties of this logic come at a cost: MSO is equivalent with the class of regular tree automata/grammars, and, thereby, with the class of context-free languages. This paper outlines one approach towards a solution of MSO's expressivity problem. On the background of an algebraically refined Chomsky hierarchy, which allows the definition of several classes of languages--in particular, a whole hierarchy between CF and CS--via regular tree grammars over unambiguously derivable alphabets of varying complexity plus their respective yield-functions, it shows that not only some non-context-free string languages can be captured by context-free means in this way, but that this approach can be generalized to the corresponding structures. I.e., non-recognizable sets of structures can--up to homomorphism--be coded context-freely. Since the class of languages covered--Fischer's (1968} OI family of indexed languages--includes all attested instances of non-context-freeness in natural language, there exists an indirect, to be sure, but completely general way to formally describe the natural languages using a weak framework like MSO. \",\n",

       " ' Stochastic phonological grammars and acceptability In foundational works of generative phonology it is claimed that subjects can reliably discriminate between possible but non-occurring words and words that could not be English. In this paper we examine the use of a probabilistic phonological parser for words to model experimentally-obtained judgements of the acceptability of a set of nonsense words. We compared various methods of scoring the goodness of the parse as a predictor of acceptability. We found that the probability of the worst part is not the best score of acceptability, indicating that classical generative phonology and Optimality Theory miss an important fact, as these approaches do not recognise a mechanism by which the frequency of well-formed parts may ameliorate the unacceptability of low-frequency parts. We argue that probabilistic generative grammars are demonstrably a more psychologically realistic model of phonological competence than standard generative phonology or Optimality Theory. ',\n",

But this does not allow for discourse features that express expectations about what is to come in the subsequent discourse. After characterizing these expectations and their distribution in text, we show how an approach that makes use of substitution as well as adjoining on a suitably defined right frontier, can be used to both process expectations and constrain discouse processing in general.

       " ' Epistemic NP Modifiers The paper considers participles such as unknown , identified and unspecified , which in sentences such as Solange is staying in an unknown hotel have readings equivalent to an indirect question Solange is staying in a hotel, and it is not known which hotel it is. We discuss phenomena including disambiguation of quantifier scope and a restriction on the set of determiners which allow the reading in question. Epistemic modifiers are analyzed in a DRT framework with file (information state) discourse referents. The proposed semantics uses a predication on files and discourse referents which is related to recent developments in dynamic modal predicate calculus. It is argued that a compositional DRT semantics must employ a semantic type of discourse referents, as opposed to just a type of individuals. A connection is developed between the scope effects of epistemic modifiers and the scope-disambiguating effect of a certain . ',\n",

And well-written documents, describing and/or explaining the information in structured databases may be easier to comprehend, more edifying and even more convincing, than the structured data, even when presented in tabular or graphic form. Documents may be automatically generated from structured data, using techniques from the field of natural language generation. These techniques are concerned with how the content, organisation and language used in a document can be dynamically selected, depending on the audience and context.

       " \" Structure and Ostension in the Interpretation of Discourse Deixis This paper examines demonstrative pronouns used as deictics to refer to the interpretation of one or more clauses. Although this usage is frowned upon in style manuals (for example Strunk and White (1959) state that ``This. The pronoun 'this', referring to the complete sense of a preceding sentence or clause, cannot always carry the load and so may produce an imprecise statement.''), it is nevertheless very common in written text. Handling this usage poses a problem for Natural Language Understanding systems. The solution I propose is based on distinguishing between what can be pointed to and what can be referred to by virtue of pointing. I argue that a restricted set of discourse segments yield what such demonstrative pronouns can point to and a restricted set of what Nunberg (1979) has called referring functions yield what they can refer to by virtue of that pointing. \",\n",
       " \" Centering, Anaphora Resolution, and Discourse Structure Centering was formulated as a model of the relationship between attentional state, the form of referring expressions, and the coherence of an utterance within a discourse segment (Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein, 1986; Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein, 1995). In this chapter, I argue that the restriction of centering to operating within a discourse segment should be abandoned in order to integrate centering with a model of global discourse structure. The within-segment restriction causes three problems. The first problem is that centers are often continued over discourse segment boundaries with pronominal referring expressions whose form is identical to those that occur within a discourse segment. The second problem is that recent work has shown that listeners perceive segment boundaries at various levels of granularity. If centering models a universal processing phenomenon, it is implausible that each listener is using a different centering algorithm.The third issue is that even for utterances within a discourse segment, there are strong contrasts between utterances whose adjacent utterance within a segment is hierarchically recent and those whose adjacent utterance within a segment is linearly recent. This chapter argues that these problems can be eliminated by replacing Grosz and Sidner's stack model of attentional state with an alternate model, the cache model. I show how the cache model is easily integrated with the centering algorithm, and provide several types of data from naturally occurring discourses that support the proposed integrated model. Future work should provide additional support for these claims with an examination of a larger corpus of naturally occurring discourses. \",\n",

We prove a dual result: CFG parsers running in time on a grammar and a string can be used to multiply Boolean matrices in time . In the process we also provide a formal definition of parsing motivated by an informal notion due to Lang. Our result establishes one of the first limitations on general CFG parsing: a fast, practical CFG parser would yield a fast, practical BMM algorithm, which is not believed to exist. ',\n",

Major steps towards dialogue models is to know about the basic units that are used to construct a dialogue model and possible sequences. In difference to many other approaches a set of dialogue acts is not predefined by any theory or manually during the engineering process, but is learned from data that are available in an avised spoken dialogue system. The architecture is outlined and the approach is applied to the domain of appointment scheduling.

We also propose three orthogonal approaches for backing off probability estimates to cope with the large number of parameters involved. ',\n",
       " ' Similarity-Based Approaches to Natural Language Processing This thesis presents two similarity-based approaches to sparse data problems. The first approach is to build soft, hierarchical clusters: soft, because each event belongs to each cluster with some probability; hierarchical, because cluster centroids are iteratively split to model finer distinctions. Our second approach is a nearest-neighbor approach: instead of calculating a centroid for each class, as in the hierarchical clustering approach, we in essence build a cluster around each word. We compare several such nearest-neighbor approaches on a word sense disambiguation task and find that as a whole, their performance is far superior to that of standard methods. In another set of experiments, we show that using estimation techniques based on the nearest-neighbor model enables us to achieve perplexity reductions of more than 20 percent over standard techniques in the prediction of low-frequency events, and statistically significant speech recognition error-rate reduction.

       " ' explanation-based learning of data oriented parsing This paper presents a new view of Explanation-Based Learning EBL of natural language parsing. Rather than employing EBL for specializing parsers by inferring new ones, this paper suggests employing EBL for learning how to reduce ambiguity only partially. The present method consists of an EBL algorithm for learning partial-parsers, and a parsing algorithm which combines partial-parsers with existing ``full-parsers . The learned partial-parsers, implementable as Cascades of Finite State Transducers (CFSTs), recognize and combine constituents efficiently, prohibiting spurious overgeneration. The parsing algorithm combines a learned partial-parser with a given full-parser such that the role of the full-parser is limited to combining the constituents, recognized by the partial-parser, and to recognizing unrecognized portions of the input sentence. Besides the reduction of the parse-space prior to disambiguation, the present method provides a way for refining existing disambiguation models that learn stochastic grammars from tree-banks. We exhibit encouraging empirical results using a pilot implementation: parse-space is reduced substantially with minimal loss of coverage. The speedup gain for disambiguation models is exemplified by experiments with the DOP model. ',\n",
       " \" Identifying Hierarchical Structure in Sequences: A linear-time algorithm SEQUITUR is an algorithm that infers a hierarchical structure from a sequence of discrete symbols by replacing repeated phrases with a grammatical rule that generates the phrase, and continuing this process recursively. The result is a hierarchical representation of the original sequence, which offers insights into its lexical structure. The algorithm is driven by two constraints that reduce the size of the grammar, and produce structure as a by-product. SEQUITUR breaks new ground by operating incrementally. Moreover, the method's simple structure permits a proof that it operates in space and time that is linear in the size of the input. Our implementation can process 50,000 symbols per second and has been applied to an extensive range of real world sequences. \",\n",
       " \" Towards Flexible Teamwork Many AI researchers are today striving to build agent teams for complex, dynamic multi-agent domains, with intended applications in arenas such as education, training, entertainment, information integration, and collective robotics. Unfortunately, uncertainties in these complex, dynamic domains obstruct coherent teamwork. In particular, team members often encounter differing, incomplete, and possibly inconsistent views of their environment. Furthermore, team members can unexpectedly fail in fulfilling responsibilities or discover unexpected opportunities. Highly flexible coordination and communication is key in addressing such uncertainties. Simply fitting individual agents with precomputed coordination plans will not do, for their inflexibility can cause severe failures in teamwork, and their domain-specificity hinders reusability. Our central hypothesis is that the key to such flexibility and reusability is providing agents with general models of teamwork. Agents exploit such models to autonomously reason about coordination and communication, providing requisite flexibility. Furthermore, the models enable reuse across domains, both saving implementation effort and enforcing consistency. This article presents one general, implemented model of teamwork, called STEAM. The basic building block of teamwork in STEAM is joint intentions (Cohen & Levesque, 1991b); teamwork in STEAM is based on agents' building up a (partial) hierarchy of joint intentions (this hierarchy is seen to parallel Grosz & Kraus's partial SharedPlans, 1996). Furthermore, in STEAM, team members monitor the team's and individual members' performance, reorganizing the team as necessary. Finally, decision-theoretic communication selectivity in STEAM ensures reduction in communication overheads of teamwork, with appropriate sensitivity to the environmental conditions. This article describes STEAM's application in three different complex domains, and presents detailed empirical results. \",\n",

Recent approaches to text categorization focus more on algorithms than on resources involved in this operation. In contrast to this trend, we present an approach based on the integration of widely available resources as lexical databases and training collections to overcome current limitations of the task. Our approach makes use of WordNet synonymy information to increase evidence for bad trained categories. When testing a direct categorization, a WordNet based one, a training algorithm, and our integrated approach, the latter exhibits a better perfomance than any of the others. Incidentally, WordNet based approach perfomance is comparable with the training approach one. ',\n",

Second, we show how resulting data provided by each method is then combined to produce a preliminary version of a Spanish WordNet with an accuracy over 85%. The application of these combinations results on an increment of the extracted connexions of a 40% without losing accuracy.

Our approach integrates WordNet information with two training approaches through the Vector Space Model. The training approaches we test are the Rocchio (relevance feedback) and the Widrow-Hoff (machine learning) algorithms. Results obtained from evaluation show that the integration of WordNet clearly outperforms training approaches, and that an integrated technique can effectively address the classification of low frequency categories.

       " ' Semantic Similarity Based on Corpus Statistics and Lexical Taxonomy This paper presents a new approach for measuring semantic similarity/distance between words and concepts. It combines a lexical taxonomy structure with corpus statistical information so that the semantic distance between nodes in the semantic space constructed by the taxonomy can be better quantified with the computational evidence derived from a distributional analysis of corpus data. Specifically, the proposed measure is a combined approach that inherits the edge-based approach of the edge counting scheme, which is then enhanced by the node-based approach of the information content calculation. When tested on a common data set of word pair similarity ratings, the proposed approach outperforms other computational models. It gives the highest correlation value (r = 0.828) with a benchmark based on human similarity judgements, whereas an upper bound (r = 0.885) is observed when human subjects replicate the same task.

       " \" Evaluating Parsing Schemes with Entropy Indicators This paper introduces an objective metric for evaluating a parsing scheme. It is based on Shannon's original work with letter sequences, which can be extended to part-of-speech tag sequences. It is shown that this regular language is an inadequate model for natural language, but a representation is used that models language slightly higher in the Chomsky hierarchy. We show how the entropy of parsed and unparsed sentences can be measured. If the entropy of the parsed sentence is lower, this indicates that some of the structure of the language has been captured. We apply this entropy indicator to support one particular parsing scheme that effects a top down segmentation. This approach could be used to decompose the parsing task into computationally more tractable subtasks. It also lends itself to the extraction of predicate/argument structure. \",\n",
       " ' An Abstract Machine for Unification Grammars This work describes the design and implementation of an abstract machine, Amalia, for the linguistic formalism ALE, which is based on typed feature structures. This formalism is one of the most widely accepted in computational linguistics and has been used for designing grammars in various linguistic theories, most notably HPSG. Amalia is composed of data structures and a set of instructions, augmented by a compiler from the grammatical formalism to the abstract instructions, and a (portable) interpreter of the abstract instructions. The effect of each instruction is defined using a low-level language that can be executed on ordinary hardware. The advantages of the abstract machine approach are twofold. From a theoretical point of view, the abstract machine gives a well-defined operational semantics to the grammatical formalism. This ensures that grammars specified using our system are endowed with well defined meaning. It enables, for example, to formally verify the correctness of a compiler for HPSG, given an independent definition. From a practical point of view, Amalia is the first system that employs a direct compilation scheme for unification grammars that are based on typed feature structures. The use of amalia results in a much improved performance over existing systems. In order to test the machine on a realistic application, we have developed a small-scale, HPSG-based grammar for a fragment of the Hebrew language, using Amalia as the development platform. This is the first application of HPSG to a Semitic language. ',\n",

We discuss several message-passing protocols for parsing and provide reasons for sacrificing completeness of the parse in favor of efficiency based on a preliminary empirical evaluation. ',\n",
       " ' Off-line Parsability and the Well-foundedness of Subsumption Typed feature structures are used extensively for the specification of linguistic information in many formalisms. The subsumption relation orders TFSs by their information content. We prove that subsumption of acyclic TFSs is well-founded, whereas in the presence of cycles general TFS subsumption is not well-founded. We show an application of this result for parsing, where the well-foundedness of subsumption is used to guarantee termination for grammars that are off-line parsable. We define a new version of off-line parsability that is less strict than the existing one; thus termination is guaranteed for parsing with a larger set of grammars. ',\n",
       " ' Using Single Layer Networks for Discrete, Sequential Data: An Example from Natural Language Processing A natural language parser which has been successfully implemented is described. This is a hybrid system, in which neural networks operate within a rule based framework. It can be accessed via telnet for users to try on their own text. (For details, contact the author.) Tested on technical manuals, the parser finds the subject and head of the subject in over 90% of declarative sentences. The neural processing components belong to the class of Generalized Single Layer Networks GSLN. In general, supervised, feed-forward networks need more than one layer to process data. However, in some cases data can be pre-processed with a non-linear transformation, and then presented in a linearly separable form for subsequent processing by a single layer net. Such networks offer advantages of functional transparency and operational speed. For our parser, the initial stage of processing maps linguistic data onto a higher order representation, which can then be analysed by a single layer network. This transformation is supported by information theoretic analysis. ',\n",
       " \" Amalia -- A Unified Platform for Parsing and Generation Contemporary linguistic theories (in particular, HPSG) are declarative in nature: they specify constraints on permissible structures, not how such structures are to be computed. Grammars designed under such theories are, therefore, suitable for both parsing and generation. However, practical implementations of such theories don't usually support bidirectional processing of grammars. We present a grammar development system that includes a compiler of grammars (for parsing and generation) to abstract machine instructions, and an interpreter for the abstract machine language. The generation compiler inverts input grammars (designed for parsing) to a form more suitable for generation. The compiled grammars are then executed by the interpreter using one control strategy, regardless of whether the grammar is the original or the inverted version. We thus obtain a unified, efficient platform for developing reversible grammars. \",\n",

The method uses paragraphs as the basic segments for identifying hierarchical discourse structure in the text, applying lexical similarity between them as the proximity test. Linear segmentation can be induced from the identified structure through application of two simple rules. However the hierarchy can be used also for intelligent exploration of the text. The proposed segmentation algorithm is evaluated against an accepted linear segmentation method and shows comparable results. ',\n",
       " \" Analysis of Three-Dimensional Protein Images A fundamental goal of research in molecular biology is to understand protein structure. Protein crystallography is currently the most successful method for determining the three-dimensional (3D) conformation of a protein, yet it remains labor intensive and relies on an expert's ability to derive and evaluate a protein scene model. In this paper, the problem of protein structure determination is formulated as an exercise in scene analysis. A computational methodology is presented in which a 3D image of a protein is segmented into a graph of critical points. Bayesian and certainty factor approaches are described and used to analyze critical point graphs and identify meaningful substructures, such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets. Results of applying the methodologies to protein images at low and medium resolution are reported. The research is related to approaches to representation, segmentation and classification in vision, as well as to top-down approaches to protein structure prediction. \",\n",
       " \" Tagging French Without Lexical Probabilities -- Combining Linguistic Knowledge And Statistical Learning This paper explores morpho-syntactic ambiguities for French to develop a strategy for part-of-speech disambiguation that a) reflects the complexity of French as an inflected language, b) optimizes the estimation of probabilities, c) allows the user flexibility in choosing a tagset. The problem in extracting lexical probabilities from a limited training corpus is that the statistical model may not necessarily represent the use of a particular word in a particular context. In a highly morphologically inflected language, this argument is particularly serious since a word can be tagged with a large number of parts of speech. Due to the lack of sufficient training data, we argue against estimating lexical probabilities to disambiguate parts of speech in unrestricted texts. Instead, we use the strength of contextual probabilities along with a feature we call ``genotype'', a set of tags associated with a word. Using this knowledge, we have built a part-of-speech tagger that combines linguistic and statistical approaches: contextual information is disambiguated by linguistic rules and n-gram probabilities on parts of speech only are estimated in order to disambiguate the remaining ambiguous tags. \",\n",

One of them is the use of finite-state machines for part of speech tagging. Linguistic and statistical information is represented in terms of weights on transitions in weighted finite-state transducers. Another contribution is the successful combination of techniques -- linguistic and statistical -- for word disambiguation, compounded with the notion of word classes. ',\n",

We describe the integration of controlled disjunctions into a HPSG feature structure representation. Finally, we present a direct implementation by means of delayed evaluation and we develop an example within the functionnal programming paradigm. ',\n",
       " ' Parsing syllables: modeling OT computationally In this paper, I propose to implement syllabification in OT as a parser. I propose several innovations that result in a finite and small candidate set. The candidate set problem is handled with several moves: i) MAX and DEP violations are not hypothesized by the parser, ii) candidates are encoded locally, and iii) EVAL is applied constraint by constraint. The parser I propose is implemented in Prolog. It has a number of desirable consequences. First, it runs and thus provides an existence proof that syllabification can be implemented in OT. There are a number of other desirable consequences as well. First, constraints are implemented as finite-state transducers. Second, the parser makes several interesting claims about the phonological properties of so-called nonrecoverable insertions and deletions. Third, the implementation suggests some particular reformulations of some of the benchmark constraints in the OT arsenal, e.g. *COMPLEX, PARSE, ONSET, and NOCODA. ',\n",
       " ' Attaching Multiple Prepositional Phrases: Generalized Backed-off Estimation There has recently been considerable interest in the use of lexically-based statistical techniques to resolve prepositional phrase attachments. To our knowledge, however, these investigations have only considered the problem of attaching the first PP, i.e., in a [V NP PP] configuration. In this paper, we consider one technique which has been successfully applied to this problem, backed-off estimation, and demonstrate how it can be extended to deal with the problem of multiple PP attachment. The multiple PP attachment introduces two related problems: sparser data (since multiple PPs are naturally rarer), and greater syntactic ambiguity (more attachment configurations which must be distinguished). We present and algorithm which solves this problem through re-use of the relatively rich data obtained from first PP training, in resolving subsequent PP attachments. ',\n",

We apply a machine learning program, C4.5, to induce decision trees for cue occurrence and placement from a corpus of data coded for a variety of features previously thought to affect cue usage. Our experiments enable us to identify the features with most predictive power, and show that machine learning can be used to induce decision trees useful for text generation. ',\n",
       " \" A Corpus-Based Investigation of Definite Description Use We present the results of a study of definite descriptions use in written texts aimed at assessing the feasibility of annotating corpora with information about definite description interpretation. We ran two experiments, in which subjects were asked to classify the uses of definite descriptions in a corpus of 33 newspaper articles, containing a total of 1412 definite descriptions. We measured the agreement among annotators about the classes assigned to definite descriptions, as well as the agreement about the antecedent assigned to those definites that the annotators classified as being related to an antecedent in the text. The most interesting result of this study from a corpus annotation perspective was the rather low agreement (K=0.63) that we obtained using versions of Hawkins' and Prince's classification schemes; better results (K=0.76) were obtained using the simplified scheme proposed by Fraurud that includes only two classes, first-mention and subsequent-mention. The agreement about antecedents was also not complete. These findings raise questions concerning the strategy of evaluating systems for definite description interpretation by comparing their results with a standardized annotation. From a linguistic point of view, the most interesting observations were the great number of discourse-new definites in our corpus (in one of our experiments, about 50% of the definites in the collection were classified as discourse-new, 30% as anaphoric, and 18% as associative/bridging) and the presence of definites which did not seem to require a complete disambiguation. \",\n",
       " ' Probabilistic Event Categorization This paper describes the automation of a new text categorization task. The categories assigned in this task are more syntactically, semantically, and contextually complex than those typically assigned by fully automatic systems that process unseen test data. Our system for assigning these categories is a probabilistic classifier, developed with a recent method for formulating a probabilistic model from a predefined set of potential features. This paper focuses on feature selection. It presents a number of fully automatic features. It identifies and evaluates various approaches to organizing collocational properties into features, and presents the results of experiments covarying type of organization and type of property. We find that one organization is not best for all kinds of properties, so this is an experimental parameter worth investigating in NLP systems. In addition, the results suggest a way to take advantage of properties that are low frequency but strongly indicative of a class. The problems of recognizing and organizing the various kinds of contextual information required to perform a linguistically complex categorization task have rarely been systematically investigated in NLP.

       " ' A Model Approximation Scheme for Planning in Partially Observable Stochastic Domains Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a natural model for planning problems where effects of actions are nondeterministic and the state of the world is not completely observable. It is difficult to solve POMDPs exactly. This paper proposes a new approximation scheme. The basic idea is to transform a POMDP into another one where additional information is provided by an oracle. The oracle informs the planning agent that the current state of the world is in a certain region. The transformed POMDP is consequently said to be region observable. It is easier to solve than the original POMDP. We propose to solve the transformed POMDP and use its optimal policy to construct an approximate policy for the original POMDP. By controlling the amount of additional information that the oracle provides, it is possible to find a proper tradeoff between computational time and approximation quality. In terms of algorithmic contributions, we study in details how to exploit region observability in solving the transformed POMDP. To facilitate the study, we also propose a new exact algorithm for general POMDPs. The algorithm is conceptually simple and yet is significantly more efficient than all previous exact algorithms.

       " ' Dynamic Non-Bayesian Decision Making The model of a non-Bayesian agent who faces a repeated game with incomplete information against Nature is an appropriate tool for modeling general agent-environment interactions. In such a model the environment state (controlled by Nature) may change arbitrarily, and the feedback/reward function is initially unknown. The agent is not Bayesian, that is he does not form a prior probability neither on the state selection strategy of Nature, nor on his reward function. A policy for the agent is a function which assigns an action to every history of observations and actions. Two basic feedback structures are considered. In one of them -- the perfect monitoring case -- the agent is able to observe the previous environment state as part of his feedback, while in the other -- the imperfect monitoring case -- all that is available to the agent is the reward obtained. Both of these settings refer to partially observable processes, where the current environment state is unknown. Our main result refers to the competitive ratio criterion in the perfect monitoring case. We prove the existence of an efficient stochastic policy that ensures that the competitive ratio is obtained at almost all stages with an arbitrarily high probability, where efficiency is measured in terms of rate of convergence. It is further shown that such an optimal policy does not exist in the imperfect monitoring case. Moreover, it is proved that in the perfect monitoring case there does not exist a deterministic policy that satisfies our long run optimality criterion. In addition, we discuss the maxmin criterion and prove that a deterministic efficient optimal strategy does exist in the imperfect monitoring case under this criterion. Finally we show that our approach to long-run optimality can be viewed as qualitative, which distinguishes it from previous work in this area. ',\n",
       " ' Storing and Indexing Plan Derivations through Explanation-based Analysis of Retrieval Failures Case-Based Planning CBP provides a way of scaling up domain-independent planning to solve large problems in complex domains. It replaces the detailed and lengthy search for a solution with the retrieval and adaptation of previous planning experiences. In general, CBP has been demonstrated to improve performance over generative (from-scratch) planning. However, the performance improvements it provides are dependent on adequate judgements as to problem similarity. In particular, although CBP may substantially reduce planning effort overall, it is subject to a mis-retrieval problem. The success of CBP depends on these retrieval errors being relatively rare. This paper describes the design and implementation of a replay framework for the case-based planner DERSNLP+EBL. DERSNLP+EBL extends current CBP methodology by incorporating explanation-based learning techniques that allow it to explain and learn from the retrieval failures it encounters. These techniques are used to refine judgements about case similarity in response to feedback when a wrong decision has been made. The same failure analysis is used in building the case library, through the addition of repairing cases. Large problems are split and stored as single goal subproblems. Multi-goal problems are stored only when these smaller cases fail to be merged into a full solution. An empirical evaluation of this approach demonstrates the advantage of learning from experienced retrieval failure. ',\n",
       " ' Learning string edit distance In many applications, it is necessary to determine the similarity of two strings. A widely-used notion of string similarity is the edit distance: the minimum number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to transform one string into the other. In this report, we provide a stochastic model for string edit distance. Our stochastic model allows us to learn a string edit distance function from a corpus of examples. We illustrate the utility of our approach by applying it to the difficult problem of learning the pronunciation of words in conversational speech. In this application, we learn a string edit distance with one fourth the error rate of the untrained Levenshtein distance. Our approach is applicable to any string classification problem that may be solved using a similarity function against a database of labeled prototypes.

       " ' Approximating Context-Free Grammars with a Finite-State Calculus Although adequate models of human language for syntactic analysis and semantic interpretation are of at least context-free complexity, for applications such as speech processing in which speed is important finite-state models are often preferred. These requirements may be reconciled by using the more complex grammar to automatically derive a finite-state approximation which can then be used as a filter to guide speech recognition or to reject many hypotheses at an early stage of processing. A method is presented here for calculating such finite-state approximations from context-free grammars. It is essentially different from the algorithm introduced by Pereira and Wright (1991; 1996), is faster in some cases, and has the advantage of being open-ended and adaptable. ',\n",
       " ' Probabilistic Constraint Logic Programming This paper addresses two central problems for probabilistic processing models: parameter estimation from incomplete data and efficient retrieval of most probable analyses. These questions have been answered satisfactorily only for probabilistic regular and context-free models. We address these problems for a more expressive probabilistic constraint logic programming model. We present a log-linear probability model for probabilistic constraint logic programming. On top of this model we define an algorithm to estimate the parameters and to select the properties of log-linear models from incomplete data. This algorithm is an extension of the improved iterative scaling algorithm of Della-Pietra, Della-Pietra, and Lafferty (1995). Our algorithm applies to log-linear models in general and is accompanied with suitable approximation methods when applied to large data spaces. Furthermore, we present an approach for searching for most probable analyses of the probabilistic constraint logic programming model. This method can be applied to the ambiguity resolution problem in natural language processing applications. ',\n",
       " ' Probabilistic Parsing Using Left Corner Language Models We introduce a novel parser based on a probabilistic version of a left-corner parser. The left-corner strategy is attractive because rule probabilities can be conditioned on both top-down goals and bottom-up derivations. We develop the underlying theory and explain how a grammar can be induced from analyzed data. We show that the left-corner approach provides an advantage over simple top-down probabilistic context-free grammars in parsing the Wall Street Journal using a grammar induced from the Penn Treebank. We also conclude that the Penn Treebank provides a fairly weak testbed due to the flatness of its bracketings and to the obvious overgeneration and undergeneration of its induced grammar. ',\n",
       " ' Variation and Synthetic Speech We describe the approach to linguistic variation taken by the Motorola speech synthesizer. A pan-dialectal pronunciation dictionary is described, which serves as the training data for a neural network based letter-to-sound converter. Subsequent to dictionary retrieval or letter-to-sound generation, pronunciations are submitted a neural network based postlexical module. The postlexical module has been trained on aligned dictionary pronunciations and hand-labeled narrow phonetic transcriptions. This architecture permits the learning of individual postlexical variation, and can be retrained for each speaker whose voice is being modeled for synthesis. Learning variation in this way can result in greater naturalness for the synthetic speech that is produced by the system. ',\n",
       " ' Application-driven automatic subgrammar extraction The space and run-time requirements of broad coverage grammars appear for many applications unreasonably large in relation to the relative simplicity of the task at hand. On the other hand, handcrafted development of application-dependent grammars is in danger of duplicating work which is then difficult to re-use in other contexts of application. To overcome this problem, we present in this paper a procedure for the automatic extraction of application-tuned consistent subgrammars from proved large-scale generation grammars. The procedure has been implemented for large-scale systemic grammars and builds on the formal equivalence between systemic grammars and typed unification based grammars. Its evaluation for the generation of encyclopedia entries is described, and directions of future development, applicability, and extensions are discussed. ',\n",

The hard task of recognizing spontaneous speech on the telephone may greatly benefit from the use of specific language models during the recognition of callers' utterances. By 'specific language models' we mean a set of language models that are trained on contextually appropriated data, and that are used during different states of the dialogue on the basis of the information sent to the acoustic level by the dialogue management module. In this paper we describe how the specific language models are obtained on the basis of contextual information. The experimental result we report show that recognition and understanding performance are improved thanks to the use of specific language models. \",\n",

Dialogos allows access to the Italian Railways timetable by using the telephone over the public network. The language modelling aspects of specificity and behaviour to rare events are studied. A technique for getting a language model more robust, based on sentences generated by grammars, is presented. Experimental results show the benefit of the proposed technique. The increment of performance between language models created using grammars and usual ones, is higher when the amount of training material is limited. Therefore this technique can give an advantage especially for the development of language models in a new domain. ',\n",
       " \" On the use of expectations for detecting and repairing human-machine miscommunication In this paper I describe how miscommunication problems are dealt with in the spoken language system DIALOGOS. The dialogue module of the system exploits dialogic expectations in a twofold way: to model what future user utterance might be about (predictions), and to account how the user's next utterance may be related to previous ones in the ongoing interaction (pragmatic-based expectations). The analysis starts from the hypothesis that the occurrence of miscommunication is concomitant with two pragmatic phenomena: the deviation of the user from the expected behaviour and the generation of a conversational implicature. A preliminary evaluation of a large amount of interactions between subjects and DIALOGOS shows that the system performance is enhanced by the uses of both predictions and pragmatic-based expectations. \",\n",
       " \" Some apparently disjoint aims and requirements for grammar development environments: the case of natural language generation Grammar development environments (GDE's) for analysis and for generation have not yet come together. Despite the fact that analysis-oriented GDE's (such as ALEP) may include some possibility of sentence generation, the development techniques and kinds of resources suggested are apparently not those required for practical, large-scale natural language generation work. Indeed, there is no use of `standard' (i.e., analysis-oriented) GDE's in current projects/applications targetting the generation of fluent, coherent texts. This unsatisfactory situation requires some analysis and explanation, which this paper attempts using as an example an extensive GDE for generation. The support provided for distributed large-scale grammar development, multilinguality, and resource maintenance are discussed and contrasted with analysis-oriented approaches. \",\n",

Inspite of the approximations and limitations of this preliminary work, the results are very encouraging and should justify more work along the same lines. ',\n",

       " ' The effect of alternative tree representations on tree bank grammars The performance of PCFGs estimated from tree banks is sensitive to the particular way in which linguistic constructions are represented as trees in the tree bank. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the effect of different tree representations for PP attachment on PCFG models, and introduces a new methodology for empirically examining such effects using tree transformations. It shows that one transformation, which copies the label of a parent node onto the labels of its children, can improve the performance of a PCFG model in terms of labelled precision and recall on held out data from 73% (precision) and 69% (recall) to 80% and 79% respectively. It also points out that if only maximum likelihood parses are of interest then many productions can be ignored, since they are subsumed by combinations of other productions in the grammar. In the Penn II tree bank grammar, almost 9% of productions are subsumed in this way. ',\n",
       " \" Type-driven semantic interpretation and feature dependencies in R-LFG Once one has enriched LFG's formal machinery with the linear logic mechanisms needed for semantic interpretation as proposed by Dalrymple et. al., it is natural to ask whether these make any existing components of LFG redundant. As Dalrymple and her colleagues note, LFG's f-structure completeness and coherence constraints fall out as a by-product of the linear logic machinery they propose for semantic interpretation, thus making those f-structure mechanisms redundant. Given that linear logic machinery or something like it is independently needed for semantic interpretation, it seems reasonable to explore the extent to which it is capable of handling feature structure constraints as well. R-LFG represents the extreme position that all linguistically required feature structure dependencies can be captured by the resource-accounting machinery of a linear or similiar logic independently needed for semantic interpretation, making LFG's unification machinery redundant. The goal is to show that LFG linguistic analyses can be expressed as clearly and perspicuously using the smaller set of mechanisms of R-LFG as they can using the much larger set of unification-based mechanisms in LFG: if this is the case then we will have shown that positing these extra f-structure mechanisms is not linguistically warranted. \",\n",
       " ' Bidirectional Heuristic Search Reconsidered The assessment of bidirectional heuristic search has been incorrect since it was first published more than a quarter of a century ago. For quite a long time, this search strategy did not achieve the expected results, and there was a major misunderstanding about the reasons behind it. Although there is still wide-spread belief that bidirectional heuristic search is afflicted by the problem of search frontiers passing each other, we demonstrate that this conjecture is wrong. Based on this finding, we present both a new generic approach to bidirectional heuristic search and a new approach to dynamically improving heuristic values that is feasible in bidirectional search only. These approaches are put into perspective with both the traditional and more recently proposed approaches in order to facilitate a better overall understanding. Empirical results of experiments with our new approaches show that bidirectional heuristic search can be performed very efficiently and also with limited memory. These results suggest that bidirectional heuristic search appears to be better for solving certain difficult problems than corresponding unidirectional search. This provides some evidence for the usefulness of a search strategy that was long neglected. In summary, we show that bidirectional heuristic search is viable and consequently propose that it be reconsidered. ',\n",
       " ' When Gravity Fails: Local Search Topology Local search algorithms for combinatorial search problems frequently encounter a sequence of states in which it is impossible to improve the value of the objective function; moves through these regions, called plateau moves, dominate the time spent in local search. We analyze and characterize plateaus for three different classes of randomly generated Boolean Satisfiability problems. We identify several interesting features of plateaus that impact the performance of local search algorithms. We show that local minima tend to be small but occasionally may be very large. We also show that local minima can be escaped without unsatisfying a large number of clauses, but that systematically searching for an escape route may be computationally expensive if the local minimum is large. We show that plateaus with exits, called benches, tend to be much larger than minima, and that some benches have very few exit states which local search can use to escape. We show that the solutions (i.e., global minima) of randomly generated problem instances form clusters, which behave similarly to local minima. We revisit several enhancements of local search algorithms and explain their performance in light of our results. Finally we discuss strategies for creating the next generation of local search algorithms. ',\n",

       " \" Context as a Spurious Concept I take issue with AI formalizations of context, primarily the formalization by McCarthy and Buvac, that regard context as an undefined primitive whose formalization can be the same in many different kinds of AI tasks. In particular, any theory of context in natural language must take the special nature of natural language into account and cannot regard context simply as an undefined primitive. I show that there is no such thing as a coherent theory of context simpliciter -- context pure and simple -- and that context in natural language is not the same kind of thing as context in KR. In natural language, context is constructed by the speaker and the interpreter, and both have considerable discretion in so doing. Therefore, a formalization based on pre-defined contexts and pre-defined `lifting axioms' cannot account for how context is used in real-world language. \",\n",

Concepts denoted by words, phrases, and proper names in the document are represented positionally as nodes in the graph along with edges corresponding to semantic relations between items. Given a perspective in terms of which the pair of documents is to be summarized, the algorithm first uses a spreading activation technique to discover, in each document, nodes semantically related to the topic. The activated graphs of each document are then matched to yield a graph corresponding to similarities and differences between the pair, which is rendered in natural language.

A major factor affecting a user's impression of a given topic word graph is the balance between common topic words and specific topic words.

In this paper I look at this issue in relation to Information Extraction (hereafter IE), and one subtask for which both lexical and general knowledge are required, Word Sense Disambiguation WSD. The analysis is based on the widely-used, but little-discussed distinction between an IE system's foreground lexicon, containing the domain's key terms which map onto the database fields of the output formalism, and the background lexicon, containing the remainder of the vocabulary. For the foreground lexicon, human lexicography is required. For the background lexicon, automatic acquisition is appropriate. For the foreground lexicon, WSD will occur as a by-product of finding a coherent semantic interpretation of the input. WSD techniques as discussed in recent literature are suited only to the background lexicon. Once the foreground/background distinction is developed, there is a match between what is possible, given the state of the art in WSD, and what is required, for high-quality IE. \",\n",
       " \" I don't believe in word senses Word sense disambiguation assumes word senses. Within the lexicography and linguistics literature, they are known to be very slippery entities. The paper looks at problems with existing accounts of `word sense' and describes the various kinds of ways in which a word's meaning can deviate from its core meaning. An analysis is presented in which word senses are abstractions from clusters of corpus citations, in accordance with current lexicographic practice. The corpus citations, not the word senses, are the basic objects in the ontology. The corpus citations will be clustered into senses according to the purposes of whoever or whatever does the clustering. In the absence of such purposes, word senses do not exist. Word sense disambiguation also needs a set of word senses to disambiguate between. In most recent work, the set has been taken from a general-purpose lexical resource, with the assumption that the lexical resource describes the word senses of English/French/..., between which NLP applications will need to disambiguate. The implication of the paper is, by contrast, that word senses exist only relative to a task. \",\n",
       " \" Speech Repairs, Intonational Boundaries and Discourse Markers: Modeling Speakers' Utterances in Spoken Dialog In this thesis, we present a statistical language model for resolving speech repairs, intonational boundaries and discourse markers. Rather than finding the best word interpretation for an acoustic signal, we redefine the speech recognition problem to so that it also identifies the POS tags, discourse markers, speech repairs and intonational phrase endings (a major cue in determining utterance units). Adding these extra elements to the speech recognition problem actually allows it to better predict the words involved, since we are able to make use of the predictions of boundary tones, discourse markers and speech repairs to better account for what word will occur next. Furthermore, we can take advantage of acoustic information, such as silence information, which tends to co-occur with speech repairs and intonational phrase endings, that current language models can only regard as noise in the acoustic signal. The output of this language model is a much fuller account of the speaker's turn, with part-of-speech assigned to each word, intonation phrase endings and discourse markers identified, and speech repairs detected and corrected. In fact, the identification of the intonational phrase endings, discourse markers, and resolution of the speech repairs allows the speech recognizer to model the speaker's utterances, rather than simply the words involved, and thus it can return a more meaningful analysis of the speaker's turn for later processing. \",\n",

       " ' Orthographic Structuring of Human Speech and Texts: Linguistic Application of Recurrence Quantification Analysis A methodology based upon recurrence quantification analysis is proposed for the study of orthographic structure of written texts. Five different orthographic data sets (20th century Italian poems, 20th century American poems, contemporary Swedish poems with their corresponding Italian translations, Italian speech samples, and American speech samples) were subjected to recurrence quantification analysis, a procedure which has been found to be diagnostically useful in the quantitative assessment of ordered series in fields such as physics, molecular dynamics, physiology, and general signal processing. Recurrence quantification was developed from recurrence plots as applied to the analysis of nonlinear, complex systems in the physical sciences, and is based on the computation of a distance matrix of the elements of an ordered series (in this case the letters consituting selected speech and poetic texts). From a strictly mathematical view, the results show the possibility of demonstrating invariance between different language exemplars despite the apparent low-level of coding (orthography). Comparison with the actual texts confirms the ability of the method to reveal recurrent structures, and their complexity. Using poems as a reference standard for judging speech complexity, the technique exhibits language independence, order dependence and freedom from pure statistical characteristics of studied sequences, as well as consistency with easily identifiable texts. Such studies may provide phenomenological markers of hidden structure as coded by the purely orthographic level. ',\n",

On the other hand, the many frameworks and schemes proposed in the literature for theory update and revision are plagued by serious complexity-theoretic impediments, even in the Horn case, as was pointed out by Eiter and Gottlob (1992), and is further demonstrated in the present paper. More fundamentally, these schemes are not inductive, in that they may lose in a single update any positive properties of the represented sets of formulas (small size, Horn structure, etc.). In this paper we propose a new scheme, incremental recompilation, which combines Horn approximation and model-based updates; this scheme is inductive and very efficient, free of the problems facing its constituents. A set of formulas is represented by an upper and lower Horn approximation. To update, we replace the upper Horn formula by the Horn envelope of its minimum-change update, and similarly the lower one by the Horn core of its update; the key fact which enables this scheme is that Horn envelopes and cores are easy to compute when the underlying formula is the result of a minimum-change update of a Horn formula by a clause. We conjecture that efficient algorithms are possible for more complex updates. \",\n",

This means that adding a formula to the premises can invalidate some of the consequences. There may, however, exist formulae that can always be safely added to the premises without destroying any of the consequences: we say they respect monotonicity. Also, there may be formulae that, when they are a consequence, can not be invalidated when adding any formula to the premises: we call them conservative. We study these two classes of formulae for preferential logics, and show that they are closely linked to the formulae whose truth-value is preserved along the (preferential) ordering. We will consider some preferential logics for illustration, and prove syntactic characterization results for them. The results in this paper may improve the efficiency of theorem provers for preferential logics. ',\n",

Discourse markers are denoted by special POS tags, and thus the process of POS tagging can be used to identify discourse markers. By incorporating POS tagging into language modeling, discourse markers can be identified during speech recognition, in which the timeliness of the information can be used to help predict the following words. We contrast this approach with an alternative machine learning approach proposed by Litman (1996). This paper also argues that discourse markers can be used to help the hearer predict the role that the upcoming utterance plays in the dialog. Thus discourse markers should provide valuable evidence for automatic dialog act prediction. ',\n",

Here we investigate three partial memory-based learning approaches which remove from memory specific task instance types estimated to be exceptional. The three approaches each implement one heuristic function for estimating exceptionality of instance types: (i) typicality, (ii) class prediction strength, and (iii) friendly-neighbourhood size. Experiments are performed with the memory-based learning algorithm IB1-IG trained on English word pronunciation. We find that removing instance types with low prediction strength (ii) is the only tested method which does not seriously harm generalisation accuracy. We conclude that keeping full memory of types rather than tokens, and excluding minority ambiguities appear to be the only performance-preserving optimisations of memory-based learning. ',\n",

We challenge this assumption for the case of English word pronunciation. Using IGTree, an inductive-learning decision-tree algorithms, we train and test three word-pronunciation systems in which the number of abstraction levels (implemented as sequenced modules) is reduced from five, via three, to one. The latter system, classifying letter strings directly as mapping to phonemes with stress markers, yields significantly better generalisation accuracies than the two multi-module systems. Analyses of empirical results indicate that positive utility effects of sequencing modules are outweighed by cascading errors passed on between modules. ',\n",

We focus on the counting task of constructing contingency tables, but our approach is also applicable to counting the number of records in a dataset that match conjunctive queries. Subject to certain assumptions, the costs of these operations can be shown to be independent of the number of records in the dataset and loglinear in the number of non-zero entries in the contingency table. We provide a very sparse data structure, the ADtree, to minimize memory use. We provide analytical worst-case bounds for this structure for several models of data distribution. We empirically demonstrate that tractably-sized data structures can be produced for large real-world datasets by (a) using a sparse tree structure that never allocates memory for counts of zero, (b) never allocating memory for counts that can be deduced from other counts, and (c) not bothering to expand the tree fully near its leaves. We show how the ADtree can be used to accelerate Bayes net structure finding algorithms, rule learning algorithms, and feature selection algorithms, and we provide a number of empirical results comparing ADtree methods against traditional direct counting approaches. We also discuss the possible uses of ADtrees in other machine learning methods, and discuss the merits of ADtrees in comparison with alternative representations such as kd-trees, R-trees and Frequent Sets.

The domain independent approaches are applicable across a variety of domains, but may not be very efficient in any one given domain. The domain dependent approaches need to be (re)designed for each domain separately, but can be very efficient in the domain for which they are designed. One enticing alternative to these approaches is to automatically synthesize domain independent planners given the knowledge about the domain and the theory of planning. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using existing automated software synthesis tools to support such synthesis. Specifically, we describe an architecture called CLAY in which the Kestrel Interactive Development System KIDS is used to derive a domain-customized planner through a semi-automatic combination of a declarative theory of planning, and the declarative control knowledge specific to a given domain, to semi-automatically combine them to derive domain-customized planners. We discuss what it means to write a declarative theory of planning and control knowledge for KIDS, and illustrate our approach by generating a class of domain-specific planners using state space refinements. Our experiments show that the synthesized planners can outperform classical refinement planners (implemented as instantiations of UCP, Kambhampati & Srivastava, 1995), using the same control knowledge. We will contrast the costs and benefits of the synthesis approach with conventional methods for customizing domain independent planners. ',\n",
       " \" Tractability of Theory Patching In this paper we consider the problem of `theory patching', in which we are given a domain theory, some of whose components are indicated to be possibly flawed, and a set of labeled training examples for the domain concept. The theory patching problem is to revise only the indicated components of the theory, such that the resulting theory correctly classifies all the training examples. Theory patching is thus a type of theory revision in which revisions are made to individual components of the theory. Our concern in this paper is to determine for which classes of logical domain theories the theory patching problem is tractable. We consider both propositional and first-order domain theories, and show that the theory patching problem is equivalent to that of determining what information contained in a theory is `stable' regardless of what revisions might be performed to the theory. We show that determining stability is tractable if the input theory satisfies two conditions: that revisions to each theory component have monotonic effects on the classification of examples, and that theory components act independently in the classification of examples in the theory. We also show how the concepts introduced can be used to determine the soundness and completeness of particular theory patching algorithms. \",\n",
       " ' Automating Coreference: The Role of Annotated Training Data We report here on a study of interannotator agreement in the coreference task as defined by the Message Understanding Conference (MUC-6 and MUC-7). Based on feedback from annotators, we clarified and simplified the annotation specification. We then performed an analysis of disagreement among several annotators, concluding that only 16% of the disagreements represented genuine disagreement about coreference; the remainder of the cases were mostly typographical errors or omissions, easily reconciled. Initially, we measured interannotator agreement in the low 80s for precision and recall. To try to improve upon this, we ran several experiments. In our final experiment, we separated the tagging of candidate noun phrases from the linking of actual coreferring expressions. This method shows promise - interannotator agreement climbed to the low 90s - but it needs more extensive validation. These results position the research community to broaden the coreference task to multiple languages, and possibly to different kinds of coreference. ',\n",
       " ' Time, Tense and Aspect in Natural Language Database Interfaces Most existing natural language database interfaces (NLDBs) were designed to be used with database systems that provide very limited facilities for manipulating time-dependent data, and they do not support adequately temporal linguistic mechanisms (verb tenses, temporal adverbials, temporal subordinate clauses, etc.). The database community is becoming increasingly interested in temporal database systems, that are intended to store and manipulate in a principled manner information not only about the present, but also about the past and future. When interfacing to temporal databases, supporting temporal linguistic mechanisms becomes crucial. We present a framework for constructing natural language interfaces for temporal databases (NLTDBs), that draws on research in tense and aspect theories, temporal logics, and temporal databases. The framework consists of a temporal intermediate representation language, called TOP, an HPSG grammar that maps a wide range of questions involving temporal mechanisms to appropriate TOP expressions, and a provably correct method for translating from TOP to TSQL2, TSQL2 being a recently proposed temporal extension of the SQL database language. This framework was employed to implement a prototype NLTDB using ALE and Prolog. ',\n",

       " ' Graph Interpolation Grammars: a Rule-based Approach to the Incremental Parsing of Natural Languages Graph Interpolation Grammars are a declarative formalism with an operational semantics. Their goal is to emulate salient features of the human parser, and notably incrementality. The parsing process defined by GIGs incrementally builds a syntactic representation of a sentence as each successive lexeme is read. A GIG rule specifies a set of parse configurations that trigger its application and an operation to perform on a matching configuration. Rules are partly context-sensitive; furthermore, they are reversible, meaning that their operations can be undone, which allows the parsing process to be nondeterministic. These two factors confer enough expressive power to the formalism for parsing natural languages. ',\n",

The paper identifies three subset construction algorithms which treat epsilon-moves. A number of experiments has been performed which indicate that the algorithms differ considerably in practice. Furthermore, the experiments suggest that the average number of epsilon-moves per state can be used to predict which algorithm is likely to perform best for a given input automaton. ',\n",
       " \" Corpus-Based Word Sense Disambiguation Resolution of lexical ambiguity, commonly termed ``word sense disambiguation'', is expected to improve the analytical accuracy for tasks which are sensitive to lexical semantics. Such tasks include machine translation, information retrieval, parsing, natural language understanding and lexicography. Reflecting the growth in utilization of machine readable texts, word sense disambiguation techniques have been explored variously in the context of corpus-based approaches. Within one corpus-based framework, that is the similarity-based method, systems use a database, in which example sentences are manually annotated with correct word senses. Given an input, systems search the database for the most similar example to the input. The lexical ambiguity of a word contained in the input is resolved by selecting the sense annotation of the retrieved example. In this research, we apply this method of resolution of verbal polysemy, in which the similarity between two examples is computed as the weighted average of the similarity between complements governed by a target polysemous verb. We explore similarity-based verb sense disambiguation focusing on the following three methods. First, we propose a weighting schema for each verb complement in the similarity computation. Second, in similarity-based techniques, the overhead for manual supervision and searching the large-sized database can be prohibitive. To resolve this problem, we propose a method to select a small number of effective examples, for system usage. Finally, the efficiency of our system is highly dependent on the similarity computation used. To maximize efficiency, we propose a method which integrates the advantages of previous methods for similarity computation. \",\n",
       " ' Integrative Windowing In this paper we re-investigate windowing for rule learning algorithms. We show that, contrary to previous results for decision tree learning, windowing can in fact achieve significant run-time gains in noise-free domains and explain the different behavior of rule learning algorithms by the fact that they learn each rule independently. The main contribution of this paper is integrative windowing, a new type of algorithm that further exploits this property by integrating good rules into the final theory right after they have been discovered. Thus it avoids re-learning these rules in subsequent iterations of the windowing process. Experimental evidence in a variety of noise-free domains shows that integrative windowing can in fact achieve substantial run-time gains. Furthermore, we discuss the problem of noise in windowing and present an algorithm that is able to achieve run-time gains in a set of experiments in a simple domain with artificial noise. ',\n",

       " ' Group Theory and Grammatical Description This paper presents a model for linguistic description based on group theory. A grammar in this model, or G-grammar , is a collection of lexical expressions which are products of logical forms, phonological forms, and their inverses. Phrasal descriptions are obtained by forming products of lexical expressions and by cancelling contiguous elements which are inverses of each other. We show applications of this model to parsing and generation, long-distance movement, and quantifier scoping. We believe that by moving from the free monoid over a vocabulary V --- standard in formal language studies --- to the free group over V, deep affinities between linguistic phenomena and classical algebra come to the surface, and that the consequences of tapping the mathematical connections thus established could be considerable.

The Blinker project was so named after the ``bilingual linker'' GUI, which was created to enable bilingual annotators to ``link'' word tokens that are mutual translations in parallel texts. The parallel text chosen for this project was the Bible, because it is probably the easiest text to obtain in electronic form in multiple languages. The languages involved were English and French, because, of the languages with which the project co-ordinator was familiar, these were the two for which a sufficient number of annotators was likely to be found. \",\n",
       " ' Models of Co-occurrence A model of co-occurrence in bitext is a boolean predicate that indicates whether a given pair of word tokens co-occur in corresponding regions of the bitext space. Co-occurrence is a precondition for the possibility that two tokens might be mutual translations. Models of co-occurrence are the glue that binds methods for mapping bitext correspondence with methods for estimating translation models into an integrated system for exploiting parallel texts. Different models of co-occurrence are possible, depending on the kind of bitext map that is available, the language-specific information that is available, and the assumptions made about the nature of translational equivalence. Although most statistical translation models are based on models of co-occurrence, modeling co-occurrence correctly is more difficult than it may at first appear. ',\n",

These annotations are freely available to the research community from http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~melamed . The annotations can be used for several purposes. First, they can be used as a standard data set for developing and testing translation lexicons and statistical translation models. Second, researchers in lexical semantics will be able to mine the annotations for insights about cross-linguistic lexicalization patterns. Third, the annotations can be used in research into certain recently proposed methods for monolingual word-sense disambiguation. This paper describes the annotated texts, the specially-designed annotation tool, and the strategies employed to increase the consistency of the annotations. The annotation process was repeated five times by different annotators. Inter-annotator agreement rates indicate that the annotations are reasonably reliable and that the method is easy to replicate.

       " ' Word-to-Word Models of Translational Equivalence Parallel texts (bitexts) have properties that distinguish them from other kinds of parallel data. First, most words translate to only one other word. Second, bitext correspondence is noisy. This article presents methods for biasing statistical translation models to reflect these properties. Analysis of the expected behavior of these biases in the presence of sparse data predicts that they will result in more accurate models. The prediction is confirmed by evaluation with respect to a gold standard -- translation models that are biased in this fashion are significantly more accurate than a baseline knowledge-poor model. This article also shows how a statistical translation model can take advantage of various kinds of pre-existing knowledge that might be available about particular language pairs. Even the simplest kinds of language-specific knowledge, such as the distinction between content words and function words, is shown to reliably boost translation model performance on some tasks. Statistical models that are informed by pre-existing knowledge about the model domain combine the best of both the rationalist and empiricist traditions. ',\n",
       " ' The Proper Treatment of Optimality in Computational Phonology This paper presents a novel formalization of optimality theory. Unlike previous treatments of optimality in computational linguistics, starting with Ellison (1994), the new approach does not require any explicit marking and counting of constraint violations. It is based on the notion of lenient composition, defined as the combination of ordinary composition and priority union. If an underlying form has outputs that can meet a given constraint, lenient composition enforces the constraint; if none of the output candidates meet the constraint, lenient composition allows all of them. For the sake of greater efficiency, we may leniently compose the GEN relation and all the constraints into a single finite-state transducer that maps each underlying form directly into its optimal surface realizations, and vice versa, without ever producing any failing candidates. Seen from this perspective, optimality theory is surprisingly similar to the two older strains of finite-state phonology: classical rewrite systems and two-level models. In particular, the ranking of optimality constraints corresponds to the ordering of rewrite rules. ',\n",

       " \" A Descriptive Characterization of Tree-Adjoining Languages (Full Version) Since the early Sixties and Seventies it has been known that the regular and context-free languages are characterized by definability in the monadic second-order theory of certain structures. More recently, these descriptive characterizations have been used to obtain complexity results for constraint- and principle-based theories of syntax and to provide a uniform model-theoretic framework for exploring the relationship between theories expressed in disparate formal terms. These results have been limited, to an extent, by the lack of descriptive characterizations of language classes beyond the context-free. Recently, we have shown that tree-adjoining languages (in a mildly generalized form) can be characterized by recognition by automata operating on three-dimensional tree manifolds, a three-dimensional analog of trees. In this paper, we exploit these automata-theoretic results to obtain a characterization of the tree-adjoining languages by definability in the monadic second-order theory of these three-dimensional tree manifolds. This not only opens the way to extending the tools of model-theoretic syntax to the level of TALs, but provides a highly flexible mechanism for defining TAGs in terms of logical constraints. This is the full version of a paper to appear in the proceedings of COLING-ACL'98 as a project note. \",\n",
       " \" Discovery of Linguistic Relations Using Lexical Attraction This work has been motivated by two long term goals: to understand how humans learn language and to build programs that can understand language. Using a representation that makes the relevant features explicit is a prerequisite for successful learning and understanding. Therefore, I chose to represent relations between individual words explicitly in my model. Lexical attraction is defined as the likelihood of such relations. I introduce a new class of probabilistic language models named lexical attraction models which can represent long distance relations between words and I formalize this new class of models using information theory. Within the framework of lexical attraction, I developed an unsupervised language acquisition program that learns to identify linguistic relations in a given sentence. The only explicitly represented linguistic knowledge in the program is lexical attraction. There is no initial grammar or lexicon built in and the only input is raw text. Learning and processing are interdigitated. The processor uses the regularities detected by the learner to impose structure on the input. This structure enables the learner to detect higher level regularities. Using this bootstrapping procedure, the program was trained on 100 million words of Associated Press material and was able to achieve 60% precision and 50% recall in finding relations between content-words. Using knowledge of lexical attraction, the program can identify the correct relations in syntactically ambiguous sentences such as ``I saw the Statue of Liberty flying over New York.'' \",\n",
       " \" Integrating Text Plans for Conciseness and Coherence Our experience with a critiquing system shows that when the system detects problems with the user's performance, multiple critiques are often produced. Analysis of a corpus of actual critiques revealed that even though each individual critique is concise and coherent, the set of critiques as a whole may exhibit several problems that detract from conciseness and coherence, and consequently assimilation. Thus a text planner was needed that could integrate the text plans for individual communicative goals to produce an overall text plan representing a concise, coherent message. This paper presents our general rule-based system for accomplishing this task. The system takes as input a \\\\emph{set} of individual text plans represented as RST-style trees, and produces a smaller set of more complex trees representing integrated messages that still achieve the multiple communicative goals of the individual text plans. Domain-independent rules are used to capture strategies across domains, while the facility for addition of domain-dependent rules enables the system to be tuned to the requirements of a particular domain. The system has been tested on a corpus of critiques in the domain of trauma care. \",\n",

In order to develop effective procedures it is necessary to identify and respond to the context factors, i.e. input, purpose, and output factors, that bear on summarising and its evaluation. The paper analyses and illustrates these factors and their implications for evaluation. It then argues that this analysis, together with the state of the art and the intrinsic difficulty of summarising, imply a nearer-term strategy concentrating on shallow, but not surface, text analysis and on indicative summarising. This is illustrated with current work, from which a potentially productive research programme can be developed. ',\n",
       " \" Recognizing Syntactic Errors in the Writing of Second Language Learners This paper reports on the recognition component of an intelligent tutoring system that is designed to help foreign language speakers learn standard English. The system models the grammar of the learner, with this instantiation of the system tailored to signers of American Sign Language ASL. We discuss the theoretical motivations for the system, various difficulties that have been encountered in the implementation, as well as the methods we have used to overcome these problems. Our method of capturing ungrammaticalities involves using mal-rules (also called 'error productions'). However, the straightforward addition of some mal-rules causes significant performance problems with the parser. For instance, the ASL population has a strong tendency to drop pronouns and the auxiliary verb `to be'. Being able to account for these as sentences results in an explosion in the number of possible parses for each sentence. This explosion, left unchecked, greatly hampers the performance of the system. We discuss how this is handled by taking into account expectations from the specific population (some of which are captured in our unique user model). The different representations of lexical items at various points in the acquisition process are modeled by using mal-rules, which obviates the need for multiple lexicons. The grammar is evaluated on its ability to correctly diagnose agreement problems in actual sentences produced by ASL native speakers. \",\n",
       " ' A Selective Macro-learning Algorithm and its Application to the NxN Sliding-Tile Puzzle One of the most common mechanisms used for speeding up problem solvers is macro-learning. Macros are sequences of basic operators acquired during problem solving. Macros are used by the problem solver as if they were basic operators. The major problem that macro-learning presents is the vast number of macros that are available for acquisition. Macros increase the branching factor of the search space and can severely degrade problem-solving efficiency. To make macro learning useful, a program must be selective in acquiring and utilizing macros. This paper describes a general method for selective acquisition of macros. Solvable training problems are generated in increasing order of difficulty. The only macros acquired are those that take the problem solver out of a local minimum to a better state. The utility of the method is demonstrated in several domains, including the domain of NxN sliding-tile puzzles. After learning on small puzzles, the system is able to efficiently solve puzzles of any size. ',\n",

We show how such indicators are computed and how correlations between them and the choice of a noun phrase description of a named entity can be automatically established using supervised learning. Based on this correlation, we have developed a technique for automatic lexical choice of descriptions of entities in text generation. We discuss the underlying relationship between the pragmatics of choosing an appropriate description that serves a specific purpose in the automatically generated text and the semantics of the description itself. We present our work in the framework of the more general concept of reuse of linguistic structures that are automatically extracted from large corpora. We present a formal evaluation of our approach and we conclude with some thoughts on potential applications of our method. ',\n",
       " ' Model-Based Diagnosis using Structured System Descriptions This paper presents a comprehensive approach for model-based diagnosis which includes proposals for characterizing and computing preferred diagnoses, assuming that the system description is augmented with a system structure (a directed graph explicating the interconnections between system components). Specifically, we first introduce the notion of a consequence, which is a syntactically unconstrained propositional sentence that characterizes all consistency-based diagnoses and show that standard characterizations of diagnoses, such as minimal conflicts, correspond to syntactic variations on a consequence. Second, we propose a new syntactic variation on the consequence known as negation normal form NNF and discuss its merits compared to standard variations. Third, we introduce a basic algorithm for computing consequences in NNF given a structured system description. We show that if the system structure does not contain cycles, then there is always a linear-size consequence in NNF which can be computed in linear time. For arbitrary system structures, we show a precise connection between the complexity of computing consequences and the topology of the underlying system structure. Finally, we present an algorithm that enumerates the preferred diagnoses characterized by a consequence. The algorithm is shown to take linear time in the size of the consequence if the preference criterion satisfies some general conditions. ',\n",

Our research explores the utility of a machine learning method called Transformation-Based Learning TBL in computing dialogue acts, because TBL has a number of advantages over alternative approaches for this application. We have identified some extensions to TBL that are necessary in order to address the limitations of the original algorithm and the particular demands of discourse processing. We use a Monte Carlo strategy to increase the applicability of the TBL method, and we select features of utterances that can be used as input to improve the performance of TBL.

This enables Transformation- Based Learning to apply to a wider range of domains, as it can effectively consider a larger number of different features and feature interactions in the data. In addition, the Monte Carlo improvement decreases the labor demands on the human developer, who no longer needs to develop a minimal set of rule templates to maintain tractability. ',\n",

In this paper, we demonstrate how the three different cases can be distinguished in terms of the beliefs ascribed to the speaker of the utterance.

We present strategies for constructing a set of dialogue act cues automatically by minimizing the entropy of the distribution of dialogue acts in a training corpus, filtering out irrelevant dialogue act cues, and clustering semantically-related words. In addition, to address limitations of TBL, we introduce a Monte Carlo strategy for training efficiently and a committee method for computing confidence measures.

       " ' Unlimited Vocabulary Grapheme to Phoneme Conversion for Korean TTS This paper describes a grapheme-to-phoneme conversion method using phoneme connectivity and CCV conversion rules. The method consists of mainly four modules including morpheme normalization, phrase-break detection, morpheme to phoneme conversion and phoneme connectivity check. The morpheme normalization is to replace non-Korean symbols into standard Korean graphemes. The phrase-break detector assigns phrase breaks using part-of-speech POS information. In the morpheme-to-phoneme conversion module, each morpheme in the phrase is converted into phonetic patterns by looking up the morpheme phonetic pattern dictionary which contains candidate phonological changes in boundaries of the morphemes. Graphemes within a morpheme are grouped into CCV patterns and converted into phonemes by the CCV conversion rules. The phoneme connectivity table supports grammaticality checking of the adjacent two phonetic morphemes. In the experiments with a corpus of 4,973 sentences, we achieved 99.9% of the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion performance and 97.5% of the sentence conversion performance. The full Korean TTS system is now being implemented using this conversion method. ',\n",

We exemplify the method by addressing the question, What percentage of Federal Register documents are real documents, of possible interest to a text researcher or analyst? We estimate an answer to this question by evaluating 200 documents selected from a corpus of 45,820 Federal Register documents. Stratified sampling is used to reduce the sampling uncertainty of the estimate from over 3100 documents to fewer than 1000.

       " \" Textual Economy through Close Coupling of Syntax and Semantics We focus on the production of efficient descriptions of objects, actions and events. We define a type of efficiency, textual economy, that exploits the hearer's recognition of inferential links to material elsewhere within a sentence. Textual economy leads to efficient descriptions because the material that supports such inferences has been included to satisfy independent communicative goals, and is therefore overloaded in Pollack's sense. We argue that achieving textual economy imposes strong requirements on the representation and reasoning used in generating sentences. The representation must support the generator's simultaneous consideration of syntax and semantics. Reasoning must enable the generator to assess quickly and reliably at any stage how the hearer will interpret the current sentence, with its (incomplete) syntax and semantics. We show that these representational and reasoning requirements are met in the SPUD system for sentence planning and realization. \",\n",
       " ' Evaluating a Focus-Based Approach to Anaphora Resolution We present an approach to anaphora resolution based on a focusing algorithm, and implemented within an existing MUC (Message Understanding Conference) Information Extraction system, allowing quantitative evaluation against a substantial corpus of annotated real-world texts. Extensions to the basic focusing mechanism can be easily tested, resulting in refinements to the mechanism and resolution rules. Results are compared with the results of a simpler heuristic-based approach. ',\n",
       " \" The Role of Verbs in Document Analysis We present results of two methods for assessing the event profile of news articles as a function of verb type. The unique contribution of this research is the focus on the role of verbs, rather than nouns. Two algorithms are presented and evaluated, one of which is shown to accurately discriminate documents by type and semantic properties, i.e. the event profile. The initial method, using WordNet (Miller et al. 1990), produced multiple cross-classification of articles, primarily due to the bushy nature of the verb tree coupled with the sense disambiguation problem. Our second approach using English Verb Classes and Alternations EVCA Levin (1993) showed that monosemous categorization of the frequent verbs in WSJ made it possible to usefully discriminate documents. For example, our results show that articles in which communication verbs predominate tend to be opinion pieces, whereas articles with a high percentage of agreement verbs tend to be about mergers or legal cases. An evaluation is performed on the results using Kendall's Tau. We present convincing evidence for using verb semantic classes as a discriminant in document classification. \",\n",
       " \" Centering in Dynamic Semantics Centering theory posits a discourse center, a distinguished discourse entity that is the topic of a discourse. A simplified version of this theory is developed in a Dynamic Semantics framework. In the resulting system, the mechanism of center shift allows a simple, elegant analysis of a variety of phenomena involving sloppy identity in ellipsis and ``paycheck pronouns''. \"]"
